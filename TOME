The Appalachian Trail
My great trial

Like the natives
Of whose blood I share

In ritual I pass thru
Great ordeal
To emerge a man

To the North
From sunrise to the right
Till it set at the left

Each step
A new step

A simple life
With a peaceful mind

To hike an unbroken
Pathway of mountain

From Georgia
2000mi
To Maine

There to seek
The ominous mountain

Natives named in reverence
Katahdin

In Buenos Aires
I drop'd an online class
This recalled all financial aide

The Dean declined
My offer to pay half
Of the five figure sum
To continue study'n
On payments

At the University of Utah
I researched an escape path

Up into Canada
Far from here
v
v
v
The Internet
In its typical fashion
Redirected me

Into an article on
The Appalachian Trail

Which I had thought
Was in South America

The distraction soon
Seen as providence

Within the hour
I had a flight to Atlanta
To arrive the next day
v
v
v
Downtown Atlanta 5am
Crackheads scurry

In final desperate efforts
To hustle up
Whatever makes their tick purr

Twisted figures
Kept to the shadows
There they jitter spastically

12hrs of roam
Till I arrived
At my CouchSurf host
Jaina from Germany

Cities
Are the loneliest places
v
v
v
In the morn
I went to search for gear
To supplement my current set
From Urban Backpack'n

A 13mi trek to
Sports Authority

By word of mouth

To make mistakes
Cheaply
v
v
v
At Pidemont Park
I eazily dozed off

A successful test of the
Thermarest Z Pad
_

A middle-aged woman
Sat swing'n

Only despair
& 2 Overstuffed suitcases

I saw her in me
But I couldn't see
Me in her

I had the momentum
Of one last
All-In

Parks
Are my favorite places
v
v
v
A couple in their 50s
Both teachers in Cummings
Invited me to stay with them

Wayne offered to pick me up
After a Couchsurfing event

We left in a rush because
He had business
To take care of

I told him
' That's fine
' Good thing I brought
' My Ereader

In that awkward way
Of tell'n your host
Not to feel burdened

Wayne only continued
' Have you ever seen someone
' That owes you money

Wayne asked more to himself
His pitch began to rise
In excitement

' You should have seen her face
' When she recognized me

Wayne cranked the music
Awake in his own world
We raced towards Downtown
v
v
v
On my long trek
To Sports Authority

I had passed the run-down
Strip club

We now pulled into

I had wondered what went on
In such a shit hole

Odd how life
Answers questions

' Hold this
Wayne handed me a pamphlet
Of some schmuck
Running for Sheriff

' Make sure she sees it
' She will get the picture
V
V
V
5pm on a weekday
My first strip club experience

Blinded by darkness
We entered into the corridor

A crack-whore
Immediately approached us

' Hey handsome
She jeers at Wayne
' I need a real man
' To get me off
She says look'n at me

Bashed by a crack-whore
Interesting

' I'm looking for Kristi
Wayne tells her
' She is working tonight
' Right?

' Oh she just left
The whore said smartly

Signal'n thru some
pre-planned method

Likely common
In this business

Wayne left me there
To rage in the restroom

His carefully crafted scheme
Thwarted
By a half-conscious whore

She turned to me
' No hard feelings, Right?
V
V
V
' This is just between us
' Couchsurfers

Wayne informs me
On the ride home

Their home was classy

I suffered the
Social sit down with his wife

I avoided them
As much as possible

I left their home
& A thank-you note

To continue my journey

Still a far distance
From the Appalachian Trailhead

My first time
Hitchike'n in the States

Most things in life
Can be accomplished
Just by try'n
_

I helped a guy roll his motorcycle
Up to the gas station

Obviously distraught
When he admitted
' I don't have any money
' To give you

Most people my entire life
Have assumed me a homeless
Or a hooker
V
V
v
40min later a woman
In a large red truck
Pulled aside

' You don't look dangerous
She said out the window

Her downs-syndrome daughter disagreed
She kept call'n me
' Bad man

In her day she had hitch'd
These where her rules:

1 - Never get into a car with more than one person
2 - Never wear a seat belt
3 - Keep the door unlocked

She also told me
To ditch my unrefrigerated balone
If I ate it I would be poisoned

Our paths overlaid
For the first half

I thanked her
Then went on my way
v
v
v
Ben picked me up
On his way to the ranch

He decided to take me
All the way to the trailhead
Amicola

I'd never heard of Amicola
But he was sure
& Didn't pay attention to my suspicion

Maybe it was the rain
That convinced him
To be the only one
After hours
To pull up aside

But some people
Will pick you up
Regardless
V
V
v
I mostly
Meet strangers

The bond of a strangers
Has only ever been of
Unbroken trust
v
v
v
Amicola Visitors Center

I signed in
Pack weight of 58lb

They gave me my only map
A paper route to Springer

Up that intense climb of stairs
A guy hike'n with his wife advised

' You only need one shirt
' & One sweater
V
V
v
After 3mi
Time to camp

I had arrived to the trail
After a long journey

The salesman at
Sports Authority
Wouldn't let me set up
The tent to test it

' I assure you
' The Hiker-Biker II
' It has room for two

Claustrophobic knots
Tied my stomach
As I looked at it

More of a bivy-sack
Than a tent

I would have to hug my pack
In order to fit inside
V
V
v
An Eagle Scout
I could make a fire
With only one match

But this wasn't the South
After 45min
I conceded defeat
_

Paranoid from the lady's advice
I threw all 3 packs of balone

Out in all directions
From my camp

Think'n it best
Not to concentrate the smell
v
V
v
Nothing was left
For me in my past

I threw away all
That I didn't take with me
In my pack
The night
Before my flight

A veteran to depression
I was prepared
With sleeping pills

To escape
The sorrowful night
v
v
v
May 20th
The morn sang

Beautiful & Bright
Lush & Vibrant

A good mood
Was inescapable

The 6mi to the
Summit of Springer
Full of heal'n
V
V
V
I had used the paper map for firestarter
The most worn paths were the ones I chose

On Springer
I began build'n a fire

A couple approached me
With 2 Powerbars

I turned them down
' I don't need Powerbars
' I can get this started
But they insisted

45min later
I was eat'n Powerbars

In Texas
A fire past a certain point
Is a healthy heart

Not so much so here
I been past that point
Numerous times
V
V
V
Two old men around a fire
Allowed me to boil eggs

I boiled the dozen
Future fire unlikely

One old man
Had hiked the trail
Twenty years ago
To the day

An adventure he started
The day after he retired

The first thru hiker
I met

His advice
Ditch all the pots
Cook from a cup
& Only sleep in shelters
v
v
v
At the end of the day
I found a shack
With someone in it

Rambo II
Christened After Rambo

The original
A black guy with a bow
Play'n around
Nearly hit someone in their tent
With an arrow

Needless to say
Rambo had to leave the trail

Rambo II begged him
For his food supplies
& Named himself Rambo II
In gratitude

Now he sat patch'n his feet
With duct tape
V
V
V
Like me he had a slingshot
Like me he had to hitch in

Unlike me
Rambo II slept in bushes

He explained
This building was a shelter

Many of which
Were scattered the entire trail

I gave him some of my ammunition
He gave me cat can
& Cube-fuel
To use as a stove

I don't think Rambo II
Ever left that shelter
v
v
v
In the morn I met
Orange & Juice

A gay couple that came out
To rough it

Speakers strapped to their pack
60lbs+ each
Short Tights & Solar Panel

They asked to borrow a lighter
I gave them one

I couldn't
Make use of it

In gratitude
They offered powwow
_

Did they know of Nessmuk
One of the saviors
Of Bushcraft

Techniques nearly lost
Of how to settle in the woods

Forced by sexual preference
To often trample in the woods
V
V
v
I'd not been high
For some time

I had been
In Argentina

Then I had been
Extremely depressed

For some time
For many reasons

Tho the morn before
Assured me with confidence

It was time to have a
Happy High

v
v
Baptized in Smoke
Affiliate'n me with

The Order of Adventurers

An Order
I desperately craved
Since childhood

Which I sought always
Tho never found

Yearn'n the wilderness
Yearn'n the roam

Yearn'n a path
With no return

Enjoy the present
The future is an
Unstable promise

Torrential rains
Ran me out my tent

To a table
Under cover of the shelter

In inches

v
v
Roadwarrior

At over 6ft tall
His eyes gave a confident
Gleam of domination

He had to finish
By a certain date
Every day of the hike was planned
v
v
v
As I copied key mileage
From Roadwarrior's books

I asked
' What does the word Blazes mean
' In this book

' Those White Blazes you been following
' Marked on the trees
Someone said clearly incredulous

I'd seen marks
Blue White & Orange

' Amicola is an
' Approach trail
' That's why it was blue
' Only the Appalachian Trail
' Is White Blazed
Dead Horse Beard
Clarified

Everyone looked at me
Like I was a
Loon or a Liar
v
v
v
Orange & Juice
Bickered nonstop

One asked if I also believed
That the other was being
Too Anti-social
& Should apologize
For the embarrassment
It had caused everyone

I felt grateful
To be alone

v
v
Army Rangers were up
All night train'n
Throw'n live grenades

Close enough for me
To be worried

Thru the day
I lost some things

Mayhap you come across

A few blue pans
Or 4lbs of
Lentils & Beans

v
v
Only 10mi in
At a beautiful clear'n

Lay a shelter
With a clear spring

DHB & Bathsalts
Already settled

They asked me
To stay

It would be rude
To refuse

I melted in my water bottle
Try'n to make them Hot Chocolate

I fell asleep after the fire

Food that can be eaten
Cold or Cooked

Is best to carry
In the woods

The balance of flavor
Must also be maintain'd

Too savory
It will be eaten too quickly

Too wholesome
You will go malnutritioned
_

Instant Oatmeal
The perfect trailfood

Light Compact
Sugary Nutritional

It can be cooked
Without fire
3hr in a water bottle

It can warm you in the morn
To wake you to a new day

It can be eaten raw
In intensive bursts
Needed to carry the day

v

I met a day hiker

He wanted to throw a wrench
Into the mechanics
That were drive'n him
Downward

There was no evidence
Of this on his face
As he offered powwow

Appalachian Heal'n
Had cast its smile

v

Eat'n lunch
With Bathsalts & DHB

I discovered on their map

Only Blood Mtn lay between
Me & my first resupply

The promise of pizza
Pass'd me over that mtn
Like it only a small hill
v
v
v
Tales had been told
Since I first arrived in Atlanta

About this Pizza

Found at the first stop
They charge hardly anything

Anything you want
Piled on top
Baked hot in the oven
Specific to your order

I caught the store workers
As they tried close'n early

' Where do I order pizza

He pointed back behind the rack
Of candy bars & beef jerky

I looked back confused

' Its in the top door
( Obviously )

The fabled pizza
Was a $2 Walmart Pizza
Quadruple priced
v
v
v
Roadwarrior looked at me with
What I could only perceive
As unpleasantness

He jumped on Jonathan
For keep'n his pace slow
V
V
v
I decided to help support this hostel
Reek'n of piss & dust

It made its living
Only for this trail

How rare to do that
In the mountains
_

That night was magical
That will forever glow

Roadwarrior & Jonathan
Bathsalts & DBH
& Some others

All of us rest'n
After the first days of adventure
V
V
V
Bathsalts cut off his straps
To save weight

He used only
Space blankets for warmth
His sandals tore into him

I christened him
Bathsalts

He would douse himself in
Talcum Powder Regularly

That night he advised me
To ditch my
Electronic shaver
To man beard it

Leave'n Neels Gap
My pack weight: 24lbs
v
v
v
Before I left
I asked the workers
For advice

They troll'd me

' I started way
' Earlier than you
' & I barely made it
' You won't make it

He was the first
To put me on that
Ruthless pace
Countless would echo

Drive'n me
Restlessly forward
v
v
v
The predatory behavior
Of outfitters is despicable

Convince'n that without 'right' gear
You wouldn't be able to hike

They rather see you spend
Your money there
Or go home defeated
v
v
v
v
As I walked out of the gap
I came upon a weary traveler

The no-longer-white shirt
Bore testament to his tales

' Came up here from
' The Florida Trail

' There was always too much water
' Or not enough

' I once had to filter water
' From a Rest Stop toilet

We sat upon the ridge
To cold lunch

' Within a week of live'n in Florida
' I went into pills
' It's bad there

' Started shoot'n pills
' Within a week

' I lost my job
' As a data analyst
' Six months later

' I'm out here to
' Redefine myself

The only Veteran Stealth Camper
I ever met
v
v
v
Get'n to the pass
That would get me to a Walmart

Passed me
Like a powerful draft

A day hiker offer'd
To drive me to town

He have'n just arrived
About to embark
On this beautiful morn

Who would I be
If I took that hour
From a sap

That had to go back
After he enters
V
V
V
An elderly man picked me up
As I walk'd

Down the pass
Thumb out

His wife & he
Drove to Alaska every year

Tho not since
She been gone

Children nor Grandchildren
Willing to accompany him

He let out
His lonely tale

Strangers are sometimes
The safest confidants
V
V
V
Often I had been that Stranger
Confident in stride

Those in moments of weakness
See this & bear their sadness upon me

Dark tales
In horrific scenes

Help'n them bear burdens
That can never be forgotten

Whether subject to the
Horrors of poverty in Mexico
Or here in the States
v
v
v
Everyone look'd at me
With disbelief

I stuffed
$100 worth of $3 goods
Into my small pack
On a bench at Walmart

I had to walk 2mi
Before a truck
Went into the parking lot
Enthusiastically honk'n

The omnipresent
Encouragement of locals

Around where the
Appalachian bears it course

Is
Phenomenal & Unparalleled
v
v
v
At the summit of
Tray Mtn

The sun wane'n
At 5pm

A group in kilts
Informed me

I missed a note
Bathsalts & DHB wrote

Despite my full pack
I made the 13mi
Still to go

Friendship is rare
I live a lonely life
v
v
v
Tomorrow
I would reach North Carolina
Nothing could change that fact
v
v
v
At every resupply
It is because

At the lowest gap in the range
A road can run thru

Make'n a quick entry to resupply
But the climb out
When you are overstuffed
Is a real muthrfkr

The past days had been
Many of those gaps

Descend'n down
' As Knob
I felt the pain

I could only crawl
Step by step
The next miles
To the water source
v
v
v
It was a measly water source
But I managed to do all my wash'n

A skill I perfected
2 years in Mexico

Ankle massaged

Wiggles dance'd
Down the mountain

She come up to my tent
On the last rays of day

To camp with me

Odd to want to camp
With a stranger
In the woods

But I allowed it
v
v
v
Wiggles re-taught me firemake'n
With simplicity

' Find alot of dry crap
' Light it in a loose bunch

' If there is no
' Dry crap to be found
' Use your stash of Birch Bark

' Birch Bark can be lit wet
' Always carry it

She was 22
Thru hiked the year before

' You can always find a way
' To keep on go'n

I explained
' I only plan to get to Maine
' I have no ties to the trail

She smartened me up
' If you can do
' Katahdin in October
' You can do anything

' Always Remember
' Don't ever leave
' Your pack high

We gather'd wood together
Into the night

Forest warped by fire
Into prance'n shadows

Later I discovered
Our meeting
Was not chance

Bathsalts & DHB
Who eventually passed me

Met her & told her
To stay with me

She smoked out a homeless
Because he said
He was a hiker

Consequently
She was freaked out

v
v
The night had been
Full of heal'n
As magic moments happen

My ankle was fine

In the early morn

My first state boundary
Simply a carve'n

Bathsalts & I read together
At a waterfall

I stayed a bit longer

Come'n thru the gap
I discovered
Some of those Memorial Day brats
Threw away the majority of
Two 24-pack of soda
& Reeses candy

There was a bag for trash
Oddly apart from the discarded sodas

Very conveniently placed
Near the Reeses
To discard the wrappers

Life is sometimes
Odd like that

I didn't know if
DHB & Bathsalts
Found this repository

So I hauled up
As many as I could

This wasn't
Go'n to waste

That creep'd out Wiggles

He told me
' Cats taste like tuna

Caught up
To my friends at camp

I told them my amazing find
& Dropped down
All the cokes

DHB was exasperated
But Bathsalts was game

DHB explained
' This was Trail Angel Food
' We should be respectful

He didn't believe
I was ignorant of the
Existence of Trail Angels

The idea that strangers
Leave food out

Which other strangers
Eat naively

Seems ludicrous for anyone with
Preschool street smarts

I laid sodas like
Easter Eggs

Thru the ridge
On my way out in the morn

There are few things spookier
Than the sound of water

When you are alone
In the woods

Water is best drought
From the source
Before the end of day

Before sight
Is replaced by sounds

Before knowledge
Is replaced with assumptions

Plops & Trickles
Drips & Flows

Become vocalized
In overtones of sadness

Remember'n its wild past
Formely held sacred
As a shrine of life

By respectful
Beasts of the forest

A Derivative of the Infinite

A sine in rhythmn
Orchestrated by the
Calculus of primal Nature

At Cold Springs Shelter
I rummaged as I always did
Look'n for food

In the firepit I found
4 Cliffbars & 6 Nature bars

Customarily

As frugal as myself
That could continue

Tho with my hustle'n
I could always score
Enough to share with others

Dead Horse Beard

Climbed with the
Stubbornness of a Beard
That continues to grow
On a Horse
Dispite it being Dead

v

I nearly stepped on
The first
Rattlesnake I encountered

I killed the beast
With one shot

Its soul-less body
Continued on

My next shot missed
As it crawled
Thru the thicket

To stop dead
Under a branch

I hit it with another shot
Just to be sure

Thus I was christened
3Shot The Rattlesnake Eater

By Trail & Error
I learned to prepare meat

My story follow'd
Ahead of me

As only stories can
For more than 1000mi

6mi to the

Walk'n from a hot meal
The Hiker Burger

' You hike'n the trail?

Then threw me a
Mountain Dew

Or the new Leki trek'n poles

Up that climb North
All dark woods & storm

Thunder & Tree Crash

Storm
In definite torrent

Dark forests
Glazed by water
In nightly glows

Up those
Twisted & Mangled Paths
Only need'n to be
Narrow enough for one

A majestic sky invoked
Super Natural Powers
Upon this ancient mountain top

Have'n long since
Come into intimate

Water treatment

Of arrogance

A childhood trait

Definite goal
In mind

Pack under
20lbs base weight

There was no bridge
To return to my past

All laid in waste

A new future must be forged
If there ever was to be one

Till I reach tomorrow
& Write down what all happened
Whether it be about

The brilliance
Of color
Off a Box Turtle shell
Slowly make'n his way
Down the mountain

Or the greasy slyness
That seeps off the
Black scales
Of a nested snake
In the hollow
Of a tree trunk

Next to the road

Fate's offer'n
To bless me with a
Birthday present

For good karma

Tracked the noob down

3am he climb'd
Into the shelter
Amidst the Cold Front

The kid in
Chuck Taylors
Id seen before NOC

I came upon him later
The next day

He nibble'd on mushrooms
That he had pick'd

He instructed
' If it tastes nutty
' Then you know its edible

' Very Wise
I agreed

He explained
' My mother doesn't like me
' I have no where else to go

I ask'd why he arrived
So late last night

' I hike at night
' I don't even need a light
' I feel the earth
' Under my soles

Truly wise words
From one so young

Clustered Dark Forests
Bramble Berry Thickets

Its moon bright

In wakeful motherly assurance

At a beautiful site
Twix two creeks cross

The rains after midnight
Left me the hard choice

Try sleep'n soak'd

Or continue to the shelter
7mi away

There to sleep dry

I decided
The only rest would be ahead

As soon as I packed

Tight paths
Thru dense wood

Trail only marked
By the light flicker'n

Whenever Elune bore her face
Upon puddles
Left by imprints of trail

Hours in
Misery of rain

Too miserable
To take off my pack
& Stash my tent
Swollen with water
In my arms all night

Hours in the
Eerie deep night fog

Amoung dark ferns
& Celestial canopy

At times crawl'n
At times circl'n

Always just hope'n
To see that geometric shape
Of manmade shelter

Harshly outlined from the scenery

I had no map
Only the promise
Of that one sign
Before my earlier camp

The Weak Haze of Morn
Broke the void of night

Finally a sign bore witness
The next shelter
8mi ahead

In the night
I missed the shelter

I set up the tent
That I in misery carried

Sleep'n dank
As 6am hit

Only to rise
In the late morn

The shelter
I had so hopefully sought

Typical of classic rural Virgina

I knocked upon
The first house

An elderly lady
Lent me her phone
Tho terrified of my presence

I'd met some people
Who like others
Took pictures of me
As I fed upon their treats

In the manner of one
Who is grateful

Always driven to feed
To be sure it is
Preoccupied

They enthusiastically
Offered to host me
When I got to this point

Told me of a pavillion
Where I could stay

I assured her
A storm is no challenge

When the storm hit
Trees fell like rain

The crash
A boom above thunder

Around one large felled tree
A Day Hiker came round

In his hysteria
He began to follow me

Back round
Up the mountain

I eventually
Had to stop & tell him

' Turn around
' You go'n the wrong way

His car was that way
His home in that direction

Reduced to crawl'n
As dark was upon me

The Clash & Bash
Of tree fall

Palpable
Tremors from the trees

Past the ridge
Upon a perch of rock

An odd beast crouch'd

Not a deer
Not only by form
But also by the way

Focused upon me
Amazed I summit'd

Head'n Down & Out

In madness of terror
While descend'n around
A fallen tree
Turn'd to follow me
Into the woods

I eventually had to stop
& Assure the man that

He needed to go the other direction
To his car
Away from this wilderness

He reluctantly complied

Not 30 yards
Between felled trees

Soon I was reduced
To crawl'n on my
Hand's & knees

Search'n for path

All pitch'd black
The earth itself rattle'n
A madness worthy of legend

Despite the dark
I did not get lost
Use'n no light

Maybe that storm shook me
Also to depths of madness

I saw a beast perch'd
The glitter of his eyes
Not that of deer

It perch'd as sure as a
Mountain Lion
It's form that distinct shape

Give'n it wide berth

Smoke'n weed on the porch
Have'n been seen that morn

I had no choice

Unable to call me a liar

In such cleverness
Did he weasel out
Of any requirement for rebuke

B-Rad hustled me a ride
The 30min drive
Back to the trail

Advised me against

Had follow'd Orange blazes

Back at the trail

Tore thru any ever heard

Placed an altar to the Gods

Seeks & Summits

A climb above
The monotony of hundreds past

Icicle draped cliffs & Monumental boulders
Technical Shifts & Slights

To rise up
Above & Alone
That day October 24th

Of my deepest desires
Sits cast the Impossible wish
To travel to extra-terrestrial spheres

Now at the winter's summit
A feat countless plainly stated Implausible

Lay UnEarthly
Blood-red flatlands

Hosts to grasses
Individually crystallized in ice

Tho hundreds of thousands
Shimmer'd in the wind

Each caught the sun
Each possessed
For that infinitesimal moment

As host to a Supreme Radiance

Changed for that instant
Into unique choirs of light


There caught of heart
The Ordeal done
& Now the moral understood

That Impossible or Implausible
Life can never truly
Be counted out

I often find myself lost deep in pathless bramble
On moonless nights up Slate Canyon

On returning
Unsuccessfully I track my path home

Alone
I look upon the unfamiliar mountainside

At the edge of a broad rock-slide
Or on the boundary of a pitched rock-face

Though there is no moon
I know there is no path

My lost predicament is neither the advance'n
Nor the retreat'n of my journey

It lies in a void of retreat'n yet advance'n
Independent of Time
I react with the universe authentically

Untainted by the idea of answers
Because there is no Future
Without a past
There was never a Question

A sort of somberness sets over me
In this warped & complicated condition

I felt that today
When I was told a certain girl got married

 To keep from freeze'n
Surrounded by the voices of

Overpowered the flame's heart

Again & Again
The bonfire wrought to naught

Awaken'n me to
Cold consciousness & duty

In slumber'n prayer
For a new day

Play aimless in the woods
With naught example to follow

An adolescent
Took care of a youngling
No mama there
To protect nor guide

The mama bear
The too-old-to-be-there bear
& The cub

In destroy'n the aggression
That the sunrise be
A new bond'n relation
Between the master
& The mammal

Jump'n off the 30ft cliff
To waters
Green, clear & warm

We waded back at dusk
Avoid'n the prick of

Round that roof

' What you think Clay

Hit me with immediate revulsion

I approached a girl
On the streets of Cancun

Her at a park
7am with a cat

The cat perched
On her backpack
As she walk'd

She was part of
La Banda

A transient gang in Mexico
That perform & sell
To fund their travels

The day spent
Run'n the streets
Ship'n her clothes
Home to Mexico City

We tested our character
Find'n a kindred need
To dodge cars & roam freely

Everyone gave
Their own peculiar look

First they thought
This girl looks like trouble

The shaved side of her head
Tattooed with leopard prints

Her arm bore
The tattoo of the
Closed Power Fist
Annotated with
' Libres

Shortest Shorts & Boots
A big ass black backpack
Where the Mijares perched

Next they would think
What business
Would this gringo have
With this street girl?

Looked like
I was try'n to buy
& She was sell'n

People on the street
Would yell things to us
That I couldn't follow
She would laugh amused

That was my first day
Back in Mexico

I left in search
Of the Lacandonian Jungle
At 4:20 pm

She gave me an adios
With a kiss on the cheek

When you live life raw
It rewards you
With people you need
When you need them
.
.
.
People listen
To the stories of my life

An adventurer
A pirate

That is how I design
The labor of my devotion

I am primal
The nomadic breadth
In me searches

Towards the open roam
To the free forage

Done in its
Own time & pace

The wilderness offers us
The answer to live harmoniously

Accept the reality of Anarchy

Fight for food
Fight for life
Fight for freedom

My motorcycle is a
Pinnacle of engineering

My server is industrial-grade

My skills grow fast
My body is fit

My unix systems
Exchange information

Anonymous & Insubstantial
As a haunt'n spirit

That Anarchy be preserved
 In this systematic epoch

Where I go I am respected
People listen
To the stories of my life
.
.
.

When the world is wrong
She tells me why

If the path ahead
Serves better as a bed
Her breath births new resolve

Often creativity
A lunatic's lie
The haze of her presence
Become the clouds
From which I fly

Frequently my words hack
Distastefully at the page
Her warm kiss lets me know
She loves me anyway

Responsibility may keep us
Apart for sometime
But not forever
She knows this with
Silent understanding

She is secure our reunion
Will be passionate
Joyous always
Our brief moments

Hand in hand
Under open sky

The grass be forever green

In the jungle you can
Give yourself time
Carry'n food

But you cannot move
Without a machete

My compass spun erratically
I grasped the GPS

Know'n if lost
Would do in the done

Normally
There is up
There is down
There is over
There is under

In the jungle
There is mostly only thru

Thru a medium of plants
By machete

Plant life so thick
I would be suspended 2ft
With 2 packs
Weighing a total of 60lbs

There is no
Watch'n for snakes

Only plunge'n body first
Into an expanse of sharp ferns
Tunnel'n thru webs of vines
Wade'n swamps waist high
That suck downwards
Towards the darkness of the mud

Navigate'n lands
Of invasive creeks
That made landmark'n impossible

There is no sanity

Turn'n right
The GPS shows
A leftward course

Travel'n straight
Towards a short fixed-distance ahead
The GPS revealed
The path a tight circle

For a short time I tasted
What it was
To be the most bad-ass person
I ever met

But now
Several weeks later
I have only one taste linger'n
The tang of defeat

I swear with exhausted soul
I will only go
To the first bushes

Just to kiss Mary
Then head back to archive

After the joint is rolled
I open the door

Amerith perks up expectantly
From the other side

He came to answer
Mary's smell

No creature
Can smile like dogs

He knows
Tonight will be epic

His misunderstand'n
His fault

After the joint is smoked
I find myself discover'n

A new trail
A better trail

One year by 5mi of mountain
& I have something new
To discover each weekend

The frosted thickets
Pink in the moonlight
Like frozen strawberry milk

But this place is not sweet
Do not reveal yourself

The woods are never empty
Do not disturb the deer
Do not attract the lion

Karma hits like a bitch
From behind with a brick

You just got to take it
Cause that's how women work

A few months ago
I was kicked out of the jungle
By a tribesman with a machete
& Another with a rifle

Can I keep risk'n life
In the pursuit of adventure?
Or do I settle hustle'n
In one place?

Get fat while the get'n is good
I guess

God knows
Adventure'n only feeds you enough
To keep on go'n
.
.
.
 My weapons are of
The Elite Grade

This machete built
Like a cleaver

Distinctly indigenous in structure
The heft of it
Would serve a butcher

Out in the Jungle
That blade served me well

Burst'n into the open
No longer lost & look'n back

Into that deep cylinder
2ft above the ground

Carved by the machete
My exodus like a drill

 Envy would grip
The tribesmen

When they tested
Its decisive cuts
.
.
.
Most memories are
Of dramatic excitements

But now in my age
I wish to cherish

The savor of new mountainsides
Or the small trickles
Of pure springs

Mother Nature's beauty
Is too emense to describe
I can only take away impressions

As many past

Up since morn
Work the day
Home to tinker

Blazed Up & Coffee brew'd

See'n the next sun
Till it well risen

Those who have
fame & honors
poser ass muthrfkrs

Here
How I am
The way I live

This is the
Pinnacle of humanity

No respect
Nor admiration

Pure from fame
Still got game

 I forge a legend
In spontaeous bursts

This life
Is not a choice
Only a reaction

A catalyst towards combustion
When paired to most environments

All torques violently
Where it receives me

Since no one else
 Is go'n to write my Legend
You get this autobiography
.
.
.
In day-to-day conversation
This past year
People commented

' You don't stink
' I thought you would stink

Yeah life got rough
I been at the bottom

Still
The top is always up

2015
Sup
.
.
.
Now I face a dark stage
I am nervous about my
 Journey to the jungle

Streets weren't safe
Preach'n wasn't safe
Trail wasn't safe
Road wasn't safe
Ride'n isn't safe

Technically
If I find a suitable water source
I should be able to survive

Technically
.
.
.
Word to my kind
Who died

Happy High & Drowned
In that lake in Maine

Leave'n 420
As your last written words

Leave'n this life
In Cold's shock

Glad you went a peaceful way
Tho your company
Would be appreciated today
.

One memory I hold special
Of all the 2400 hours uptime

Online in the
World of Warcraft
At the Timeless Isle

We put our self to the work
Of cleanse'n those
Of the faction

Twix bears the symbol
Of our blood-fued
The Horde

Fifteen cyber knights
Of The Horde

Gathered atop
To stop our crusade of kill'n

Us
Three amigos

Charged head upon them
On that hilltop

After much brave fight'n
& Death to The Horde

We charged on thru to
Get The Fuck Out

Khlamidia
The guardian-angel Night Elf

Fearwolf
The Worgan warrior

BarnabyJones
The Warlock

We all got out
Of that fight alive

Cept for Fearwolf
Respect to that fallen homie
.
.
.
When surrounded you hear
' Put your hands
' Behind your head
' We got 17 counts on you

You can then
Understand the life
& What it is like
To be Me
.
.
.
My favorite times
To do wheelies
Are when Christina
Is weigh'n down the back

Once next to a family
The light hit green
The eyes of the family
Plastered onto the minivan windows

As they saw us leap
Upon the back tire

Take'n off
Turn'n left

Thru the intersection
On one wheel
The whole way
.
.
.
Aun in Mexico City
Thousand miles
From the jungle

People knew
From the deep lashes
Upon my arms & legs
I'd been lost in the jungle
.
.
.
Christina advised
' Don't hit too hard

' I smoke Chronic
I shout'd cautiousless

Think'n this only
Pseudo-marijuana

But Ryan & Christina
Snuck in
Salvia-Times-Sixty

Black
Point of Light
Point of Dimension
Point of Area
Point of Corporal
Point of Position
Point of Global
Point of Relations

Down the rabbit hole
I fell thru reality

Until I came back up
Out the other side

Remembrance since reboot

I'd say
Life is much
Like a unix computer
.
.

Faith

Not something taught
Not something given

Found only
After long darkened toil

Faith
Not to Flip Flop

Faith
To trust a way
Around the impassible river

Faith
To cross 100mi wilderness
Sick & Crawl'n

Faith
The march forward
Dispite all external proofs
To the contrary

Faith
Isn't a knowledge
Of things not seen
That is nonsensical dogma

Faith
Is an All-In

Faith
Know'n the future should fail
Tho continue'n anyway

Faith
Understand'n
This the only way
.

The earth my mattress
The heavens my ceiling
The moon my light

My boot
The pillow upon which
I rest my weary head

A peaceful mind
With a simple life

Go'n where I care to go
Stop'n where I care to stop

My only relationship
With the sky & her dramatics

The large expanse
Cares not for my issues

Why should I care for hers?

But as she becomes
Burdened with troubles
So do I

Unable to counsel
Only Listen & Feel

I suffer her tears
I endure to her cry
.
.
.
If Life is hell
But Hell is worse

Then why do you
Now feel so terse?

An email to you my favorite
Deviant Art Artist

nicktheartisticfreak

I am very happy that you would depict my prose
I have changed the project from pedrk.com

My present life would suit best
To be memorialized

Tho I have done great deeds
Of some
Stories told & songs writ
[ autobiographical of course ]

I can deny not
My present life

Suits me best
To Boast & Brag

Enter the master bedroom
In my redneck cousin's house

You take in my
7ft steel unix server

Modular & variant
Are the levels

That compose this tank
Of an archive

You are told this archive
Has substantially
More terabytes of valuable data

Than of any known across
Defcon

ZFSdev.summit

You like the orange Osprey pack
Affectionately hook'd on top

Stained by thousands
Of miles of mountain

' Sun to the right
' Till it never set

You walk around the machine & experience
1337 Hi-Tech
Hacker command center

All black devices emanating
A Razer green light

You count
4-monitors  3-keyboards
8-*puters  10-external drives
Beautifully assembled

BSD 4 Life
Anarchy on the NET

Will you describe that?
In that Hypersexual
Violent & Macabre fashion
Of the pieces
You have long displayed

XI
My 10th Thanksgiving
My sister older by two years

Decided today
Would be the day

At the bay Downtown
Lie a building
Dark Still & Gothic

Once a place of Punishment
Now calling to all
Spirit-Seekers & Adventurers
A Testament to their Ways
-

Beauty is beheld as
Sky Sea & City
Sync in dank motions

Thru thin skin
We absorb'd charged energies

Survey'n the monolith
From the catwalk

Inhale'n Corpus Christi
From on high

Salt Street Decay
Man & Machine

Look'n down to the yard
Of the Courthouse
All Fenced & Boarded

A homeless pass'n & understand'n
Our speculation advise'd

' There
He pointed with his ancient finger
' Thru that hole in the fence

' There
He pointed to a
Particular boarded window
' That one is loose

We watched him meld into Downtown
The plan was too solid to deny

The building is large
& We hard to find
_

Damp Dim & Decrepit
All lie under a layer
Of thick Texan dust

Wooden stairs
Wide & intricately-carved
With 20ft holes

Gape to swallow the unwary
To fall to a deep belly of debris

Like teeth
Its spears wait hungrily
_

All furniture lay piled
In the center
Of each courtroom

Lump'd as one guilty heap
Lawyer Layman Judge & Jury
_

The levels went on & on
Maintain'n solidarity in theme

Matter sentenced
To hallowed depths

Matter consecrated
By memories

All conspire'n to rip down
This ancient Gomorrah
In a suicide's release
_

Condemnation kept to the
Fifth Floor

A place of horror

What light breached
Thru small windows
Was filtered further by bars
Cold Heartless & Demean'n

Have we the right to
Life & Liberty

Expulsion humane
Against this captivity
Under the hands of Beasts

Each cell an altar
Shrines Idols & Sacrifices
Adorned to encapsulate the

Infinite & Individual
Violence of the past

Victims returned on mecca
In Reconciliation

Form'n embodiments
From their suffer'n & bondage

Eject'd & Confined
Back to this temporal limbo

Birth'd & Abort'd
At this temporal junction

Complete'n a cycle
In precious ritual

One cell I remember
A doll bound

Hand & Foot
Stuck & Cut

Graffiti'd with mutilations

Then
My sister grasped my arm
Point'n thru the bars

Deep in the distance
At a large form
Swift & Search'n

' Run
She yelled

We found the stairs
Down & down
In desperate leaps

Unable to distinguish the levels
Pray'n no basement would entrap us

We emerged
Out of that building

Yet on the other side
From where we had entered

Tho young
We were both veterans
To this stage
.

' fk it lets go '
A slogan to which I default

Before death defy'n leaps
Off waterfalls
Into dark waters

Or into gateways
Open & Await'n

4am Salty
On the Cancun beach
Caked in seawater grime

The flight landed
Well into the night

I had nowhere to go
But here

I met a hustler
Empty of pocket

This zaney character
A pathway I could not decline

We made concession
I paid for a shower & a bowl

He revealed himself a Magician
& Gave me a potion
Which I drank in prudent sips

The Magick he practiced
Was of the vein of Pain

A scorch embedded
Deep in his flesh
Of a cigar ember held
By his Master
To imbue the brew we drank

His farwell was a forewarn
To not cast the elixir away
_

In the Jungle
Situation compelled me
To discard the elixir
Upon the ground
.

Babe
I'm crazy as hell

How else do you think
I have so many stories to tell

Two Thousand Miles of Mtn
Alone
Of   Course
I am
Just a little bit
     Off

I care little for
Here or There

It is the same
Pretty much everywhere

All I care for is the story

rich dick richard rick skrp
ricardo Elder bitchie-ritchie 3shot

I'm a man of many names
But what you hear of me

May prove Legend

Tho I be
As batty as a second-rate hag

Perk your ear for a hear
I always have something to tell you

Tho you think me kooky
It is because with insanity

I only see thru people
Your presence is purely ethereal
.

Mania
Diagnosed

Awesome to Live
By those Slopes

Slow ups
Go'n only one direction

& Those fast downs
Rapid but irratic
_

What religious magnificence
Works a fire into blaze

Combustions
Eminate in naked forms

Birth'd
By the hands of Man

Upon the product
Of his Mother Nature

Until ashe
Each sing songs in
Celestial Styles

Freed from
Corporal form

Over 10 long years
I wrote
Over 10 long years
It read `gibberish`

Now at the cusp of 30
The bud has bloomed

The petals of mastery
Set in place & color
_

On the Jordan River Trail
Meander'n among paths
Thru summer reeds

Calm'd by the smell
Of the stale decay

My red pen poised
Cock'd to make
The first mark of many

Tho as I read on & on
Each page
Came & went unstained

The words sang
Songs of Myself
A voice at a tune
All my own

Jason Stevo Isac & I
Captitalized on the custom
Of gas stations

To stack 12 packs of coke
Outside their glass walls

The outside is the side
To which the rambunctious
Lay claim
_

In one elaborate scheme
We hop'd over one fence
& Thru another

Form'n a Daisy Chain
Pass'n the booty under & over

Run'n hands full
Back to the Get-A-Way truck

We charge'd with the exhilaration
Of the unlikely success of execution

Jason our resident
Get-A-Way-Driver
Stood casually outside

His elbow
Prop'd upon on the hood
Of the Red Izuzu

Go! Go! Go!
We clamor

' Can't we got a flat
Jason responded cool
As if a workers union
Protected him

We got away
5mph Down the street
To stop & change tires
_

That day was canonical
Before we rampaged Downtown

The owner of that car
Will drop his jaw
When he realizes
The reason the car won't go

Is because there is a vacancy
Where the battery should be

We four continued on
To a remote haunted airfield
Long abandoned

There find'n a couch
Also abandoned

Lit a bit on fire
Which escalated into a bonfire

In the middle of
The Texan plain
_

Out back in the wastelands
Drink'n our cokes

We enjoyed the view
Of the distant Firefighters
.

Elementary

Spin'n the globe round
Love'n to slightly press
Let'n it stop randomly

Ask'n myself
' Would I go there someday?

Newfoundland always a yes

Showers

Relishment of renewal
Refresh'n Body & Soul

Cleanse'n off daily scum
Sleep'n naked in sack
Cozy & Peaceful
_

Those years in Mexico
Heat'n the water year-round
With Bucket & Hot-Iron

From Spring to Winter
In the Appalachians
Puddle or Cold-Spring

Out on the streets
Carry'n heavy sack
Civilization at Fingertips

The crave of
The comfort of
Familiarity

I studied maps of the
American Wildernesses

The Selway
I chose as our most wild
_

The nights
A cold Hell

The Ground leeched away
Heat & Sleep
From my back
In timeless torture

Eventually I added
Leaves & Scruff
As insulation to lay upon
Only to discover

The Air leeched away
Heat & Sleep
From my front
In timeless torture

My rations
Honey Soup Garlic & Cheese

Unable to kill naught
But a Rattlesnake's Mother

At the dusk of Winter
Before the teach'n of Spring

The Universe gave a Child
An unlikely opportunity
To retain heritage

The Mother & I fought
Savagely on the cliff

Unable to shoot
With my rifle nor pistol
Against the bare rock of the walls

I set at it
With my Navy Seals knife

10 long minutes of battle
Exhausted my available techniques
Into a shameful stalemate

Then I followed her glances
To a boulder nearby

She saw me look at it
With greedy eyes

I took to it
For a cheap win

With both hands tug'n
Then expose'n

Both
Den & Child

The unjust demands of life
Bade it
Bite or Run

A proper strike
Would have saved both their lives

To my death's remand
The Child fled

Consequently
He smelt the cook'n

Of his mother roast'n
On a riverbed fire
.

Alone I wander the world
No friend to match my pace
No gaze parallel to my own
A solitary pane of reality
-

In gather'n nests of hackers
None find I familiar

Adventurer tales recounted
Lack true grit

The written word
Our contemporary selfie
-

Why does the caged bird sing?
Channel'n bottled energies
Towards an Inter-Species melody

' Boys will be boys
An elderly lady justified

Green spiked hair
Handmade punk vest
Jinco Jeans
Cut off at the calves
Held up by a dangle'n noose
Boots for stomp'n

I guess I was the peacock of the bunch
But that didn't take out
Any of my kick

Dangerous
Mothers run to cover their children
Men avoid my gaze at all costs

Cops
Security Guards
Thug bitches

But a truck of rednecks
We run from those rich-bred & fed

There are many calls
Songs to bring on the night

Fits of Gossip
& Of Communication

Insects Birds Mammals Reptiles
The jungle hosts many

But there is one cry
Best over the rest

The Spanish Mating Call

How could the wild ignore
The commotion of her fuck

Not see the bamboo hut
Standing Tall & Solitary
Shudder in prolonged ecstasy

Resonate'n
From primal loins

Sacred
Irresistible

Those calls of !Que Rico!
From hot-blood

All creatures fall silent
In respect & curiosity

A good-bye to all the men
That were her friends

Leave'n all but one
Want'n with need

Shameless & Proud
Full-bodied
Smooth of pitch
Drawn in longing

For all to hear
But one to answer
.

Google Maps pathed me
To this northern town

North beyond Edmonton
It caters as a crossroads

For the only 2 highways
Continue'n North

An elderly Canadian couple hosted a garage sale
I approached them with an offer
I hope not refused

Twenty American
To lodge my motorcycle on their property

That I should continue on
To the isolated North
By hitchhike

They wouldn't let me leave
Without a full stomach

A dinner of
Friends, family, posterity

A classic canadian meal
Is always complemented
By warm'n a stranger

My lil sis Chistina
Only really ever
Says dumb things

Lose'n sense of height
Degrade'n black people
In a Jamaican jungle
Near a black man with a machete

Or in Washington DC
Insist'n a local
The National Monument was the Pentagon

Or in front of Walmart exclaim'n
' Oh shit its the Cops!
5ft from the cops

Diarrhea
Deadly flush of the bowels

Christmas Eve
I nearly died

Ulcers Fever
Salmonella & Pneumonia

Find'n the doctor in the church

Take'n her from her guests
Enjoy'n las fiestas

She tells me I need a shot

I roll up my shirt sleeve
They look at me not understand'n

' No you need to bend over
' In Mexico we shoot by butt

Merry Christmas Elder

Oh that night on the open road
The only road continue'n North

There at
Indian Cabins Beer & Liquor

The owner exhibited gold
He sifted from a nearby stream

To a speculate'n
Province Surveyor

I spectated
Despite the owners distrust

The surveyor asked where
I was headed

He took me in
With his eyes for a time

You best buy
Yourself some beer

This is an isolated place
Of unsatiated alcoholism

I'll take you as far
As the 60th Parallel North

There you will be left
To Mercy & Mosquitoes

Hold that beer high
Promote it with all you've got

Mayhap this night
You find yourself in Yellowknife

Howbeit
If you are stuck
At the 60th Parallel

Naught a sign nor house
Within 600 kilometers

Be grateful
Here the sun never sets

Be grateful
For your twelve pack

Two officers of 14 years
Lied in court
That I fought them

For justification to arrest me
Cause I was irritated
With a Transit Cop front'n up to me

Granted I did troll them
Before the hearing
As only a master could

Several months later
After the internal investigations filed
I saw the Officer

Maybe I feel regret
Understand'n his current state
But maybe not

Fk the police

Once hitch'n
I got high with a father
& His teenage son

Haven forgotten
I was in the backseat

The two continued their argue
A tension that gave no repose

The son said he felt awkward

' You fucked all my girlfriends
' That makes me feel awkward

The father broke free
His bottle'd pressure
That tensed each interaction
With his son

Say'n what need'd to be said

I felt awkward
When they remembered me
.
.
.
When I come roll'n thru
Ain't nobody you ever met
Like me

Whatever you learn of me
You always remember

Settled hazel gaze
Irritatite'n smirk
Apparel innately agressive
Beard Un-tame'd & Wild

At the last gas station
Before the US Border
Alberta side

Have'n the odd misfortune
To run out of gas
At the only place
That didn't have Premium

At the exact place
I ran out of gas
More than a week earlier

The attendant of this
One Pump Station

Remembered me distraught
From the first time
Have'n to settle for non-Premium

Stuck in the middle of pastures
Never seen most of
What was on the TV

Then to see me
A wayward traveler

Champion of adventure
A symbol of
Something-Now-Lost

Cheerily you asked
' When will you be back

' Likely never
I respond
' Where I go I seldom return

I mostly meet strangers
Strangers see me
Most accurate for who I am

If you stay a few days
In the same location

The ruckus of cries
Caused by the gossip
Of your arrival
Will become old news

Beautiful melodies
Will resume

Birds Insects
Mammal Reptiles

All synced
In a choir of joy
At the coming of night

At the bank
Of a large river

I waited out that night
So black
No inch visible

Clutch'n my machete
To my breast
Like a babe it's bear

Horrible howls called
From one side of the river
To the other

Closer & Closer
More surround'n
With each response

I lay wait'n
For dastardly monkeys
To leap upon me in gangs

Or some silent anaconda
Bored with its usual meat

Large & Swollen
From an uncontested life

To snake around & around
Coil'n me up

My hammock
A convenient trap'n
Like an American snack wrap'n.
_

That river was impassable
Cept for a natural underwater bridge

A rock formation
That ran the width
A foot under water level

I found it dure'n my bath
I planned to venture across the next day
_

It was during my morning shit
When the Lacandonians
The tribe indigenous to this jungle
Found me for the second time

They gawked at my camp
Flabbergasted

Forgien & Alien
Against the wild background

They held their rifle & machete firmly
To accent their demands
That I leave their homeland

Truthfully
I was happy to go

4am
On a winter's night

A night spent explore'n
The limits of the trail

Something came off the mtn
Its echos follow'n our own

A dark form stalked up
To the boulders at our back
Yet at a distance

We fled into the outer city
To drink from a sprinkler

It prowled over the highway
Follow'n

Head'n back to the canyon
30min later

On the other side
From where the beast
Had crossed

Shadowed by the headlights
Of the only car
Out on this abandoned stretch of road

Creep'd the form of Mtn Lion
In my blind spot
Perch'd to pounce

Scared across
Into a parking lot by the car
The Mtn Lion drew cover

Scared across
The wide pavement of the highway
Amerith & I flew

A quarter mile later
Forced to go the long way
8mi Around

I walked over
A sleep'n homeless
The Mtn Lion likely still tracked us

Remote still
This place above the tracks

Try to explain that to a homeless
Who didn't even accept money

Offered in an attempt
To pave a way to explain
The dire situation he was in

Better off he just not know
Nor feel regret at not believing
The story of a killer beast
.
.
.
If on a rainy day
You caught shelter
During the intensity of the storm
In the underground tunnel
Under the road

Huddle'n there
You saw me coming

Large umbrella
Enshroud'n a bearded man
With a Hi-Tech Nike jacket
All black & hooded tightly
Expensive jeans & kicks

Ask'n you what time it was
I approached & I passed
To allow your nervousness relief

But then stop'n
At the other end
Of that dark & deep tunnel

I asked again
' What time was that?

' 4:20
You respond again

' Oh well
' I got to be get'n back again
' Sorry
I respond in answer

Apologize'n
Because of the fear
Left forgotten on your face
Endure'n the suspicious repass'n
.

Yes

I've been told
I'm Self Absorb'd

Still
Don't give a fk

Russians catalogued millions of books
Into a database

It replicated & transported
Via torrent protocol

Most of its mirror'd databanks
Unearthed & Eradicated
But not all


In time I managed
To uncover the treasure
Of its repository
Folded in the deep
_

Months & Months
Turn'n to years
I have dedicated
Towards its acquisition

That this foreign
Yet humanitarian feat

Attain'd to retain
Our species intelligence

Be not lost
Due to tyrants & their greed

Deep in the Jamaican Blue Mountains
Thru the twisty narrow
Red dirt road

Christina & I roamed
The landlady's dog
Trail'n at our heels

The mutt displayed
Vivaciousness & Worth
Chase'n off cars

' Richie we got to stop it
' It will get hit!

I reply annoyed
But mathematically

' Christina
' The dog lives on this road
' What are the chances

' That of all the days
' Today it will get hit?

We had to return
The landlady her dog
Bloody & missing a toe

I was once approached
By a man
He was well-built
From his lifetime
Build'n with bricks

With only a few months in Mexico
Spanish easily eluded me

What I had misinterpreted
As friendly conversation
Was revealed a dire situation

When my Mexican missionary companion
Took shelter in my shadow

' Voy a rompar tu cara!
The bricklayer exclaimed fiercely at me

After he had taken the time to narrate
The mistreatment he had endured in America

My order bound me
To play the sacrificial lamb
& Take the asskick'n like a man

' Mira tu camisa
My companion squeaked from behind me
Point'n to the enrage'd man's shirt

The man unclenched his fists
& He unclenched his jaw
Which dangled open & loosely

As he stared down stoopified
At the large American Flag
He wore on his chest
.

People think
Because we are not compatible
I have some defect of character

They say I am too cocky
& I am of pure embellishment

But I see them
In complacent lives

Compared against
My great history of Adventure

What regard or relation
Could I associate with such beings

Precious souls as mine
Encounter few kindred spirits

Those I meet
Are mostly incompatible

Life goes on
In different ways
For different days

I cherish my life
Love yours

Mayhap you one day enact
a story to behold

I once met a witch
One hot summer in Mexico

Her abode
Uncannily cold upon our arrival

By the time we took our leave
The temperature would oddly normalize
Back into a noonday oven

With her mother
They would dig up the dead

To enchant the body parts
& Bind the unfortunate souls

To reveal ancient wealth
Or conspire them into curses
_

Witchcraft was rampant
As well as the worship of
La Santa Muerte

I ventured there
To preach & teach

Two long years of righteousness
& Chaste workings

Odd
Years later it was I
Who had been converted

To the only scientific god

You will visit me
I will see your face

May my death be quick

The day the Lacandonians
Kicked me out of their jungle

I returned to the nearest city
Beat down & depressed

Cancun
Several states away

Yet the girl I'd met there
More than a week prior
Was not 10 blocks away

Around 10pm
She showed up drunk

Drink'n the clear liquid
As natural as water

' Come with me to my hut
' In the jungle
' I'll take you where
 ' There are mango trees
' Stay with me tonight

She told me with those
Big beautiful bloodshot eyes

I said my goodbyes to the hostel
To a bed that I'd never sleep in

From that moment on
I began my adventure with
La Chilanga
.
.
.
The primal breadth in me searches
Towards that open roam
To that free forage
Done in its own time & pace

The natural world offers freely
The simple answer to Harmony

Who can reject
The face of this truth

Plain as the sun
It confirms the soul

Observe'n the wild where
Each Species Different & Compete'n

Accept their place
Respect no master
.
.
.
I'd lost my chance
To befriend wild monkeys

Like how I'd been unable to befriend
The adolescent bears of the Appalachians

They always ran
Tho I chased them
Call'n sweetly with treats
.
.
.
 My weapons
Are of the Elite Grade
MK-3 MOD 0 is no exception

Undercover & Accessible
Out on the road

In my pack
 Hitch'n or Cruise'n

Once at a park
South of Calgary

Where the flood has destroyed half the town
Pump'n out the contents of the sewers

A cop kicked me up
Look'n for a felon

I went easily back to sleep
A Scout is always prepared

 Consequences if assault'd
She would deliver with cruelty
.
.
.
I have gathered firewood
Thru the entire night
With a selected few

Out in the cold June forest
Past midnight in the
Parc de la Gatineau

The pit at the summit
Of roll'n wilderness

The homeless stranger & I
Search'd desperately
For firewood all night

Night a terrible cold
Like only Canada knows
.
.
.
Ottawa at dusk for the
World Unix Conference
BSDcan

Guzzel'n brews at the
Royal Oak
Ramble'n on BSD over ZFS

Leave'n early to find
Some untame ground

Past the outskirts
Of the Capital of Canada
_

' I can walk with you
' And show you the way
A UoO student got off his bike
To walk with me 15 min

Tho I merely asked
The name of the street
Always glad for company

His parents the
Classic Canadian Arizona Snowbirds

He advised I revise my plan
' Parc de la Gatineau
' Will be more gauranteed
_

20min down the path
' Utah!

Someone called out back

 ' There are free maps
' I brought one for you
' Didn't want you to get lost
' On my account

Canadian winters
Cultivate a people
Sensitive to the core

Mexicans use concrete structures as houses
Which keep heat like ovens

Beneath
The North Mexican desert sun

Up on the foothills
A cool breeze was to be had

By sleep'n on the roof
In this poor mountain village

Not one night had passed
My missionary companion & I woke
To see football-sized concrete boulders
Shatter'n inches from our heads

The un-entertained poor
Showered down meteorites from the mountains

Crash'n in heaps
All around us
_

Ain't nothing new
From remains

Left by un-entertained poor
I'd seen so far

Dogs been bound by wire
& Burnt alive

Dogs dangling from the nooses
Lashed on trees

Puppies poisoned
Into excruciating deaths

For sport from want of recreation
_

This was my missionary companion's
First & only area on his mission

He hurt himself
In attempts to be excused honorably home

I never understood why he left
.
.
.
I arrived in Hong Kong
With nowhere to go

I took 5 trains
To the islandic mountains

After meeting friends
We ate at a
Remote white-sanded beach

Rumor told of a waterfall
Just around the mountain side

Tho it was late
My companions headed out
As dusk came

A waterfall to leap from
Is worth whatever risk

Under the hot Hong Kong sun
I climbed

Up & over the mountainside

To the back reaches
To the waterfall

To arrive alone
At the last rays of day
&
 Take the leap
Into untested dark waters
.
.
.
Once as I hitch'd to Canada
The guy give'n me the lift
Offered me a job with his brother Jeff

I built houses with that
Sect of Polygamists
All summer long in Montana

I will never forget

' Jeff you know we are related
' In about 4 different ways

Yesterday
I woke in a fit of compulsion
By 7am my pack was ready

A certain day of the year
Inspires me

I took the train to its
End-of-the-line
North to Ogden

After consult'n
With the local homeless
I found the spot
To hitchhike North

Today
There was only one canyon
Between me & Helena
After 5 hours I became defeated


A rickity car pulled over
I shoved my heap of things
Into the back seat with me

They were a couple in their early 30's
Who offered me drink
Of clear liquid
From a Sprite bottle
That I declined

Further down the road
I repack'd the pile into my bag

The man drive'n
Commented wrily

' You won't be needing
' To worry about that soon

I tensed at the comment
They laughed in that lofty
Too High To Give a Fuck tone


Slowly I realized
As the car began
Careless drifts

The situation was entirely different
From what I had suspected

I released the grip of my blade
That was tuck'd out-of-sight
But never out-of-reach


The car began
More dramatic swerves
Enter'n the canyon

From the outer edge of one side
To the outer edge of the other

On this two lane highway
Northwards Butte to Helena

Our velocity a constant 80 mph

Each turn a hope for death
But never
With commitment to end

Typical of
Passive Hippie Pussies


It was thirty miles
Of canyon twists

Before the police
Chased us down

Faced to make the choice
The weak caved
_

Death has always been
A familiar face

But it was this
Long & intimate dance
That won my love


A true Celebration
Of my birthday

I was alive
But born again
.

Ferry Ride
All night

To Newfoundland
Out on deck
Closest to the ocean

Rumor told
' Gros Morne
' Remnant of the Applachians

Providence Unfold'n
The next day hitch'n

Five rides
Like fate brought me

Up those bogs
Of Gros Morn
I felt I walked
With an ancient Native

Feed'n the animals
Understand'n a different way

Three days to travel
For one night
Three days to return
_

In Benos Aires
I stayed a month with a cult

That allowed spirits to dance
All night in their bodies

I wouldn't deny
Such understand'n
.
.
.
I live a lawless life

Far or Near
Govt reigns supreme

Beast or Man
No earth to be free

An omnipresent foe
Heretorefore unimagineable

Fear can not stop me
That at risk
Worth much more than mere life
.

' Beware: Do not feed the monkeys
' They form gangs
' To rob people of their food

Monkey Hill
Hong Kong

My quest took two afternoons
End'n as I crossed the bridge

To a hill full of monkeys
Who needed a champion

The Historical Sign read
The monkeys were imported

To eat poisonous plants
Around the riverbanks
In order for this area to be founded

Now this Beware sign asks
Abandon the monkeys
To forage on their own
_

I've always wanted
To be a gang leader

Befriend these packs of monkeys
With a feast
They would recognize my value

My pack was full
Of different foods
I'd been accumulate'n
For this celebration

The monkeys may just raid
Me & my camp
Attack'n me in the night

The monkeys may just like me

They would recognize my friendly power
& Unite under my scheme'n

Either way
This was to be a party to never forget
_

Above a shrine of stone
At the point of a foothill
I set up camp for the rain

My 2nd hammock lashing
Not unpacked
Nor packed

Not anywhere
To be found

That slight piece of equipment
Would betray me of shelter
From the hard rain to come

Gamgee lesson
Never forgot

Always carry rope
_

Head'n from Monkey Hill
Back to downtown Hong Kong
 1:30am I wandered directionless

Earlier Ducki commented
She always wanted
To enter a building
But was too scared
The Indians were always fighting outside

Sure enough
As we entered
A flock of seven Indian males began fight'n

Like small sparrows
Do in a bicker
-

Now across the street
Was that same building
An Indian approached me

 With an offer I could not refuse
My own room for under $30

Sure enough
He had to fight against another Indian
But he got us to the elevator

I'd never been on an elevator that small
That had to go so high
.
.
.
The black Jamaican
Hosted us in a room
The room had a painting

A quiet night
Of a white family
Dining in their home

A black man poised
Rifle in hand
Outside the room window

The painting read
' Never Forget
.
.
.

I researched pathways
On Google Maps
Of one Hong Kong Island

Nighttime on the pathway
I saw lights
Swift & Search'n
Miles off
At the other end
Of this ocean cove

I assumed
It a Lighthouse

At the other end
Of the ocean cove
I found no lighthouse

Only a sign in
Cantonese & English
But I care naught for adversements

Up the only path
Up the hill to a village
Which cultivated the slopes
Of this Mountain Ravine

There near the summit
Lay a house
Large Wooden & Old

Odd to see a non-vacant house
Look Dead & Still

Farm paths led different places
I stayed on the path
That led to the mountain pass

The search'n lights I'd seen
From the other end
Of the ocean cove
Were now focused
On something at the mountain pass
The lights became many

The action of the beams disturbed me
By the nature of its frantic movements
To the extent I decided to retreat

Failed & deeply distraught
I knew this the only path

I headed back
There repass'n the sign
I stopped to read it

 ' If you cross this border
' You trespass
' Into a private village
' We will assume you are a thief
' And treat you accordingly

DefCon 23
Dropped off in Las Vegas
Alone with no plan at night

Under 20 minutes
I sat hold'n a
Black dealer's
Gold chain

Collateral
 As he went
To get my weed
_

Las Vegas lights are trippy
When you are high

Smoke'n a joint
You roll'd out back

The lights to my back
Turned out to be
Not the cops

But that fright startled me
My smartphone
Fell & shattered

Destroy'n any way to contact
Those who had my room

From Wed morning at 7am
Till Saturday afternoon at 3pm
 I went without sleep
_

Las Vegas

The only city
Where the night is life

& The day
Only a drunken stumble home

At a military surplus

As an Eagle Scout
It is a surprise

Of imaginations

Still peace reins

Coffee run'n its course

XXVII
After rummage'n thru a hostel
For leftover food

The workers trim'n the trees
Proselytized their community
As place to stay & eat

We traveled to their land
On the wealthy side of Virginia

This cult held
 ' All Things In Common

It was weird all over
Felt just like
My mormon childhood
.
.
.
An old Lady & I haggled
In a tucked away shop
On an off-season
Stretch of beach

She wouldn't let the piece go
But at a steep price

Nevertheless
The season was mine
' I will pay $80
' Get more cash
' And pay more in the morning

Context communicated
I don't have the cash
Take comfort in a false gamble
To save face

A split second betrayed her concession
As the woman was about to respond

Christina decided to chip in
' I promise we will come back
' You can totally trust us

I had to lecture Christina
That dure'n the logistics of hustle'n
Shut The Fk Up
Now the Jamacian
Has cause to curse

That Jamaican JuJu
Haunts me to this day

But I cannot part
With the Ironwood Artifact

Poverty is some shit
You don't know it
Unless you know it


Glue-stained nostrils of the fathers
Dirt floors & crude appliances
Of needful things

Children abused & forsaken
Where hopelessness is indeed

This work is only ever read
Under the force
Of my personal stare

I must reaffirm
That great works

By definition
Should never be grasped
Freely by whomever

Few should
Ever relate

But that is the catch isn't it?
To find the few
The masses must echo

Life is a bitch
But one has to carry on
As one must

At McDonalds

Why after all this time
Have you come to me
Age'd as I am

Why not when I was
Young & Undecided

Unable to adventure

I rose like I had everyday since
Gather'n wood for the breakfast fire

I also mistakenly
Gathered a snake

The copperhead sleepy still

I kicked Christina awake
Threw her machete at her
Command'n her to kill it

The snake woke real fast
As Christina missed

They fought thru the bramble

The copperhead strike'n
Christina miss'n

Despite the undergrowth
Christina kept her focus

The snake dove
Into a leap'n strike

The machete SHINK
Split the air

The open-mouthed head
Severed from its body

Spin'n out into the distance

3Chop held the severed body
With one hand

Then peeled down
The copperhead's skin
Off with the other

3Chop tore out the guts
Washed the twitch'n corpse
In the river

Built a fire
Roast'd the unseasoned meat
& Ate

3Chop & 3Shot
A memorable Duo
Throughout 400mi of Appalachian Mtn

My sister Megan
On back

That sleepy Sunday afternoon
In Texas

Our parents in the van behind
All on the road to our cousins

A Ford Mustang
Pulled up aside

Its engine call'n me out
Disrespectfully

On green we lurched forward
Leave'n my startled parents
In the wake of fumes

I kept our race parallel
This road had an interest'n fate

The Mustang
Screeched & Skidded

As its lane turn'd
Then ended abruptly

Born on the Air Force Base
In Mountain Home, Idaho

There ingrained
A deep respect

For the Nez Perce

The Selway Wilderness borders
A Nez Perce reservation

Remote still the edge
of that wilderness

Yet four Nez Perce
Came to where
The Salmon leap in season

Back at their home
On the Reservation

High-Schoolers Drop-Outs Parents
Party'd that school night

Wild to contest
Parties past of my Friday nights

' At my house on my couch
' You have to drive to get beer

The Rite of Death
This Ritual of Awaken'n

I give as a gift
To those I love

Christina not even a teen
Would accompany me
On late walks
Upon the Urban Streets

I-Beams that stretched
The length of this incomplete Overpass

100ft above
The ground far below

' If you make a mistake you will die

& I'd be quick to follow
 _

Sawyer took upon a great boulder
Which to climb

' If you make a mistake you will die

& I'd be quick to follow

On his own he leap'd back down
From reach'n the summit
Into my anxious arms
Overstretch'n my balance on a rock

I wildcard torrent traffic
In the upper-crust
Of the undernet

Oddities & Rareities
Fall into those gutters

Once inspect'n
What had gathered for the day

Lay a fat 52.8 GB file

Weeks of leech'n
Accumulated to acquire it whole

Internet's Best Compilation Of
How To Seduce Women
videos text & mp3

Such a thing was impossible
I proclaimed defiantly

To leech
There exist Seeds

For this monument
To not only exist
But be served consistently
Escaped any rationality

The world is wide & weird
Still Darwinian limits
Inhibit all matter

At a party with my cousin's cousin
I discovered
He had been a Seed

I regret many things I've told women
Truth isn't always best for them

Out on that Reservation Road
Of the Nez Perce

Hitch'n for a ride
But everyone pass'n

A rickity car pulled to the side
Inside I look at the driver's side to see

Daisy Duke & Blonde
As redneck as can be

' You are the prettiest person
' To ever pick me up
I add to my thank you


~ Oh your boyfriend
~ Just broke up with you
~ You shouldn't pick up at 17
~ Just drop me off

She took me up a mountain top
To leave me stranded

While she went home
To ask her parents
' if I can keep you


She picked me up a while later
As I walk'd down
Her mother in the front seat

' My mom was okay with it
' But my dad
' Didn't like the idea

Always look before you get in

In my youth my temper
Burn'd untemper'd

The Anarchist Cookbook
One of the best reads

The Tennis Ball Bomb
The only recipe
That performed remarkably

It lay on my shelf
Untested for weeks

Until my temper burn'd
Thru all sanity

Grab'n & Throw'n Blindly
I launched the bomb

For a time
I stared at it enamor'd

Despite its deep position'n
In the closet

The match-heads burst out
In healthy flow
Land'n & stay'n lit

Every single of the thousand
Match-heads ejected

My entire world
A layer of flame

Bathroom Bedroom
Closet Kitchen & Rec-Room

That West Side gang park

The one with the concrete table
That looked as the ones of stone in my books

Past midnight
Alone & Ready
To bolt at any shadow

But it was car lights
That turn'd on behind me
Parked tuck'd away

It slowly follow'd me
Down the street

Then at the sudden
Burst in a lurch at me
& Past me

Fkn cop had a good laugh
He drove off with his joke
For the day

Rampage
Second to nothing
Of all we hold dear

The ring of that havoc
True & Forever


North Beach Corpus Christi

Carries true that deep ring
Of havoc

Barclay Jason & I
Roam'd our stomp'n ground
Look'n for something to stomp

3 Hoodlums travel'd
To our city
A hood from the North

Look'n for what troublemakers look for
There find'n us

Temporary & Complementary
Were the forces that created our unique body

Like the combustion of celestial bodies
To form planets
Or destroy them in magnificence

Rummage'n up a rukus

Carried us
Paragraph upon paragraph
On the page of Night

Till Late or Early
Depend'n on if you slept or not

Back at our campground
In the marsh
Behind Jason's house we found

At those parts
Dine'd on our poptarts

Nomads drift'n

Wander'n to where next

As if parents in
Unsigned consortment
Paid their share
When visit came due

Once there was a place
That would not reject us

An abandoned warehouse
Known in the annals as
Skatehouse

Cross the street of
Miller High School

Lay the drab forgotten graveyard
Of my kin

Up & Thru
That graveyard fence
Bordered another
More recent graveyard

After those borders
You come to a grassy pathway

To where we
Cut a pathway

Thru a fence of wire
To a building
Abandoned long ago

Its concrete lot
As spacious as the oceans
Too much space to ever skate

Once some sort of
Newspaper printery
Newspapers stacked in heaps
_

Once sleep'n above in the
Overlook'n Overlord Office
All Unventilated & Grime

The night had been a wild
Party in the Graveyard

Eight of us lay there
Javi Javier Dorsey
Sal Jesus Homer
My older sister & I

Upon the 70s carpet
Caked in dust

Like sand
In a beach-side tent

Around yellow'n paper of
70s Playboy

My older sister & I
Lit them upon the candles
Spread around for light

After throw'n them
At each other

The fun spread like fire
All Toss'n & Avoid'n

We had to escape
Thru the cemeteries

As the firefighters came
Ban'n us forever
From a home span'n several months

On the streets

Roanoke offered me refuge
After the cataclysmic storm hit

Met people thru people
I was with people I'd met
From those people after that

Power been out for weeks
That crazy-muther-fkr
Who hosted me
Traded internet for bud

Maybe it was that bowl
But I do know
He was one crazy-muther-fkr

I peace'd out of there
A bit past midnight

In the center of the city
Jam'n to Die Antwoord

Someone call'd me out
From behind

From the bush that skirt
A grassy hill

Burst out a large man
Toward me
Face full of tats

' You travel'n too?
He offered friendly gather'n
To his camp at the hillcrest

Zach & I camped
All night on that foothill

Hell I didn't have
Anywhere else to go
But right here

We trade'd stories of adventure
But he trump'd me de facto
Once he killed a guy
With a pipe

That short time was of friendship
& Shared mutual respect

Now I ain't say'n Zach wasn't Scum
But he definitely ain't Trash

Stories told & Songs said
In the tales during my youth

Always up a tree
With a book

Wish'n I were the protagonist
Of some adventure

In a magical wonderland
Or in post-apocalyptic distress

Since my first morn'n out
On the Appalachian
Till now settled for the season

Reflect'n on my life
A story only Life could forge

The beauty & depth
The deepness of space

The sound of approach'n
Is unmistakable

Once heard
It betrays fully its intention

There the fear is full
_

Fortune placed us securely
In an opening of the thicket

A small boulder & brush
At the center
10ft of open space at all sides

Surrounded by
Twists & Distortions
Vegetation warped by
Stony soil

Magnum drawn
I tough talked the Lion

There are some notes
That are inter-species

You play your tune to its beat
& All will understand

To communicate
To this cocky beast

Tho this be his grounds
Tho he perceive
No foreseeable threat

I had something
Past his imaginations
That would blow
His brain out his skull

Vocal courage to break'n
To this cat's cowardice
_

20 mins passed in stalemate
The next move
Would be the beasts

It's presence
No longer heard but felt

Positioned behind the boulder
Face'n the direction
The beast had been descend'n

I focused forward
In dominate stance

My place sure
Until the beast's presence
Surely heard to the bramble
At my back

The 3am moon
Is not always bright
It wasn't bright tonight

It had successfully
Made the lengthy distance
Creep'n in circle around me

Without noise
Until that moment
Thru some preplaced path

My note & my tune
Unflustered by the sudden shift

My position I knew
Breached only partially

Upon my stolid reaction
To the change of events
Echo'd by communication

With the surprise of slyness
A cat's pride
Indisputably thwarted
Returned a growl of frustration

I can only swear
What I believe I heard

Fear truly infects sanity

All I know for certain is
Amerith would refuse to go
Into those brambles depths again

Script-kiddie's displayed
Tricks of cheap illusion

DefCon had a wall
The Wall of Sheep

To display any people present
Who got hacked
During the Con

In the room of

I entered & hid

Distressed guards & management
Look'd for me

Long eluded me

A child built on DOS
Distracted by the colorful windows of 95

Punk teenage years squandered
In the hustle
Of illicitly-traded binaries

Attempts been made to rise up
Yet the time wasn't right

College years came by & went
Still the time wasn't right

The January summer spent in Buenos Aires
Nose down a dense unix text

Fresh blind'n despair
Those 6 mo of unsuccessful installs

Tho hampered by hardware
I found myself at a FreeBSD terminal

Despite 900 pages
Of technical reads
I could produce
Only DOS commands

That was when
I swore off the 1337 dream
Forever

Squander time no more
Against obstinate deficiency

But nothing lasts forever
Stubborn
& In the pits of esteem

Work'n underpaid at a firm
Finally Stable & Able

The time was right

With vendetta

Noob foothills where
I had spent my history lost

Now obscured
By vast expenses

Depression & Trial
Still carve my path

Tho the mantle of Disdain shed
Never to be worn again

Now worthy of 1337
Now relieved
I never kept my word

Since my days strapped
By The Man
To my desk as a teen

Since my days sworn
To The Man
To selflessness as a preacher

My mind ever roam'd toward
The Full Pack
& One-Way Path

I gather'd my courage
To dream no more

Bought my Pack
Bought my Bag
Bought my Beanie
Bought my Sweater

Bought the airfare
A ten day trip to
The Mexican Rivera

Land'n there
With no plan
Or idea of where-to-next
Like I always plan'd

The guy aside brush'd me off
On that long distance
Bus to the beach
I shrugged it off

Later he passed me
His cell phone
' Soy sordo

Sergio invited me on a boat
To Cozumel

Where I met his
Deaf wife & deaf child
& Deaf friends

That night have'n no hotel
Took the overnight bus
To Chetumal

Where I met a Japanese girl
Lay'n down next to
The biggest black pack
I ever seen

Akane invited me to
Backpacker Island
On The Belize Reef

There among
The Islandic Indigenous
There engrossed
A place where life
Is readily forgotten

Days Later Burnt
I bought a joint
From my Rastafarian Host
Deep in the Belize Jungle

The crisp of my skin
Demanded it as medicine

But I decided it was time
To end the long hiatus
Since high school

Mary then was only
An old fling

Married now years later
I have never been as happy

No longer a Dreamer

He had definitely bought booze

On the dreary horizon

Instead of continue'n ahead
It juke'd backwards
Down the ravine

I unsheathed the knife
Laid down the rifle

Until enraged & ashamed
I was forced to concede defeat
Outsmarted by a Grouse

Wasn't suited for you

I don't drink
In other countries

Seems logical
To any sensibility

Threw La Chilanga
A go'n away beer-athon

At our bar
The one out back
Against the jungle

Not many besides
La Banada frequented
The tucked away spot

La Chilanga
Ban'd from the main bar

After knock'n out a girl
In one punch

To even Mickey
An experienced boxer's amaze
_

The pack returned
In the festive manner
Custom to Mexico

A French sloppily
Trailed behind

Outpaced
In this foreign race

' Let's fuck her
One of our group said

Her swing'n alone
On the hammock

Lost in the
Dark depths of booze

I had to get her up
& Lead her away

From the bamboo huts
Of the locals
& Onto the jungle path

I could only start her off

I couldn't leave La Chilanga
Too long

A man must always
Protect his own first

That is what
I had to tell myself

As I abandoned the stranger
On a wild path deep of night
.
.

Wake'n after
A dark night in
Wallows of rejection

The haze of morn
A marinated mixture
Of defeat & doubt

In the first batch of emails
An acceptance of publication
In a small journal

The first time anyone but me
Looked at my work with
More than contempt

Must be a scam

It is the stranger
That most accurately understands
The heroism of the feat

Bangor Maine
 At a truck stop

FrieghtTrain & I
Looked past homeless

A man found out
By third party
We finished the Thru

He bought us beer
& Me a mtn dew

In the fields
Out 'n back

The last October nights
Of Maine sky

Stars in that clarity
Only possible in such cold

The freeze of dark matter
Of celestial seas

Bayside

Past day
Behind a backalley nook

Find'n three locals
At my smoke spot

' Fumen?
I threw the joint handsign

Venture'n approval of locals
To partake in
Criminal activity

A risk
But necessary for me

Their answer
A cautious approval

To extinguish any suspicion
I prompted

' Te gustan blunts
Display'n the hobbit

' I've never seen a blunt
' That small

The four of us
Friends for the life
Of the blunt's haze

Don't know their names
They don't know mine

Never meet'n again

Gotta make that impression
To last past this life
.
.
.
Lost is a deep
Feel'n of forsakeness

When your being testifies:

That this place somewhere
Entirely alien
These coordinates blaze'n
A new way back

Then in the
Rich mud of the Jungle
Your imprinted footprint

Or for the fourth time
See'n that tribal face
Carved in the tree
Oddly solitary in the jungle
.

After need'n a skill
For survival

The keeness is
Dramatically intensified

Fat on the
Fruits of hustle'n
In one place

Eat'n what I want
Drink'n the finest

Thirty years old
Life never been so good

Aged but in
Pristine physique

I would offer it to Him
Sacrifice it all

For the glory
Of the moment

That Death find me
In a dignified state

Destitute of all
But a memorization
Of these songs
.

Why does
The caged bird sing

I think that now as a caged bird
Unlike the other limp dicks here

I extended & then returned
To this inevitable dystopia

Will my brethren rise?
Or stay soft under their Oppressors

I sing how I want
Out open cell windows

Cause Fk You
You taken all but that
.
.
.
Nothing to lose
Thirty now

Have'n dreamt
Tried those dreams on

Still Alive
Walk'n from those wrecks

As a man does
After the taste of Death

~ Any location good enough
~ Any sacrifice eazy enough

Cause live'n on borrowed life
Is much better than dead

To its hovel
High on the hill

Into its narrow
Caverns of dark

Where the dank
Of underground thrives

Not much is left
Now the hilltop is settled

Earth of sacred nature
Bulldozed by Residentials

Years there alone
As when I was a teen

I believed my lack of skill
Kept me lonely with no krew

None but scrubs crawl'n free

Respected Ryan's ability

Mountain summits
Barren to provide beauty

Ahead of the infinite

Where you go

The end of day
When the Earth
Uncovers the truth

Back to the blind'n blaze

Then to be glorified

In all the ecstasy
Of an explorer's discovery

& Then in revelries
Be treasured as deserved

To preserve experience
As fossil record

One must live life
Worth the effort

To be preserved

One must write
In a manner worth read'n

Songs encapsulations
Emotions of experience

Simple anti-charismatic slurs

Drunk
With adoration of oneself

Of Peace

At the twilight when
The age of man

And the Age of War
Again ensues retribution

Boy & his dog
At 19

Day bushwack'n
Foothill to ridge

At the end of day
A choice

Take the known path
Back in the boring fashion

Or go down the backside
Thru an forested valley

To come out around
The otherside of the mountain

In more of a tumble
Than a run
We made our way

Summer at its glory
All rested from the heat
Of the busy day

Desert barren foothills
To Snow thick ridges

To the summit of scapes

Thru the magic of
Valley portals

Beams of wane'n sun
With open arms welcomed

I made my way merrily
A definite conquerer of the mountains

Bleed'n from the thickets
Unquestionably defeated

After twenty minutes
After open valley ended

Conquerer of mountain
Bitch of bushes

I cried
In total breakdown
Have'n to bushwack

Straight back up the mountain

Thru small thickets
Dog shake'n all the way

Never did
Learn it tho

Discarded on the seat

Still had audacity

Sidewalk on a school corner
Sat an old fat man

Obviously the leader

Waited

As the old man

Hustler passed
The nights score

The old man
Pass'n only two rolls

We kept walk'n
Thru the city

Take'n oportunity
' Que son

He placed in my hand
One of the blunts
Cautiously

' Cuanto?

' Dos dollares
The hustler responded

Twice the amount
Of the local price

An obvious rob
But I the master

I handed him
2 Loose dollars

Ready to pay ten
For the genuine
Fresh Caribbean Roll

Twenty minutes
To arrive

The driver's direction
In vision from where he left us

This transportation terminal
A valuable hub

The hustler
Think'n he outwit me
To tag'n along to where
He also wanted to go

So to lesson
I left him as soon
As he broke away
To greet another

To summit onto the bus
Him completely ditched

I pressured the driver
To break my $10

I let the hustler marinate a while
To be open to
The lesson he was about to learn

' Ven
I called him over

We slapped hands goodbye
Pass'n that way
A folded $5

To prove to him
By universal fashions

Of gratitude
With a day's wage

We two
Of the same stock

His interpretation
Of our situation entirely inverse

We parted
Him dazed by the final jab

In the decisive Oneshot
Of a master

Troll'd them before the hearing

Caught the dickhead cop
In a lie against his testimony

Had walkway thru it

Testified that I wrestled them
For 30 seconds

Said it was under 10 seconds

Expose'n the cops

They sent the appeals court
Bogus info & I was never summoned

I gave Murray Court
A copy of my proof

The manager denied claim
To the error
' Nothing we can do

The next year
A different worker
Claimed the error
On their part

Claimed it unprecedented
& Filed a warrant
For my arrest

I'll never present myself
To a corrupt court

I cherish the expression
Of the prosecutor

Dazed
By my stupidity
_

Prosecutors
Have true power

With them
The deals are to be made

We reasoned privately
Him reasonable

For a $200
To settle this all

I told him
I'd have to think about it

When my case was near
To be heard

He asked if I accepted
I decided against offer

His jaw drop'd
He regained himself
Put me last
After everyone left

The American Dream

To stand strong
Against tyrants

No matter how
Little they be

A very unreasonable response
.
.
.
I disdain
Judges most of all

The woes of Moses
Tortured by scwabbles
That never cease

Days full of lies
& Acts
Of self preservation

Life as referee
Of people locked
By the scum of their feud

Appointed to govern
When man releases
Their inner beast
_

Judges sworn to this
So own up Muthrfkrs

No one
Forces

Your daily annoyance
Has long reach'n consequences
To those you sworn
_

No names needed
When hate to them all

Wish'n the treasure
Of a four letter curse
To damn an entire kind

That branch of Government
With most trust
& Least oversight

The branch of Government
That corrupted the others

With the darkness
Of a betrayed lover
_

A clean glove
Will never clean
The greasy slime
Without itself
Become'n the same

In infinite variation

My wife
A celestial prime

Enfold'n me
In gravitational pulls

Her alone
Able to enchant
Me to orbit

Flares & Auroras

A singular Cartesian
In planes of monotony

Her light worshiped
In local faith of remote lands
Until eclipsed to infinities

Wonders & Impossibilities
Fill tomes of poetry

A creation of gods
To be a Constant

Myself  a comet
Elevated to roles

As an Elune
Her moon

To build her
To greater beauties

Calm'n turbid waters
Set'n order to tides

Myself only a comet
But even such
Has needful purpose

A light
Rapid Small & Enamorate'n

A glimmer of hope
If the night is right

On clear rural scapes
To a stranger look'n up

Envoke'n
Prophecies & Foretell'n

The brief enchantment
To proofs
Of greater planes

Answer of prayers
By ethereal diretives of Fate

Invoked upon
Rangers of celestial seas

A humble roid
Only aspire'n
To be as molded
Lonely Cold & Overlooked

Only a light
To those laid low

Painted into darkness
By ashes of misfortune

I lead to doors
Of divergent trajectories

There to search
Promised Lands

Thru whispers
Their forefathers
Pass thru me

Sacrament
When I roll out
On open roams

In back alleys
Or forested crevices

Where shadows
Reach unheeded

In silent prayer
To place me
In harm's way

That I
Over anyone else
Play victim

The hunter
As my hunted

Make a move muthrfkr
Cause I'm always eager

To spill blood
In self-righteous gore

Nothing paints memory
Like bloodsoaked hands

Stain'n iron
Absorbed in the skin

Enriched & soften'd

Want to choose

Addicted to some shit

LXXVII
Fourth of July

The Bob Marshall
A fabled wilderness
Of North America

Its pitched ridgeline bar'n
Me & my motorcycle machine

The Forest Service
Closed for holiday

Highway 83
Near Swan Lake Montana

No where else to go
But a deep country gas station
Have'n left Helena on a whim
The epitome of out-of-place

I knew of no trail
Nor place where to start

An elderly trapper
Approached me

Disposable coffee cup
In hand
Blue Velvet cap

Pich'n upon my sight
Some welcome advice

' Follow me to the back

Great maps
Sprawled about
' There is only one trail
' In 60 miles
' That can put you past the ridge

He would do me a solid
& Host the motorcycle on his property
_

The cabin
Built by his own hands

On a Lumberman's plot
In the woods

The trailhead not many miles from the plot
I draped the tarp over the motorcycle
.
.
.
The Bob Marshall
A cold heartless bitch

Descend'n over
Over much snow

The trail not yet used
No more than once or twice this year

I went cautiously over
An iceberg of snow
At a critical pitch

I tied my skank to a tree
Flag for the crux
Back to the pass
.
.
.
Perpendicular perched
A glacial pond

That drew
Itself to me

A Siren
Sing'n her song

Blaze'n from main trail
To a grove of every type of water flow
.
.
.
The cold cultivate'n
A high altitude enchantment

Dimension
Breached, melded & interweaved

Wake & Sleep
Blurred to one

I beheld
Two men pleasantly
Talk'n on canoe
_

In the morn
I knew

If ever
I experienced ghosts
It was then

Such a sight impossible
This place secluded
As secluded can be
.
.
.
Pathfind'n in springtime
Is a real muthrfkr

Waterways blaze'n paths
Instead of the logical
Thruway of the animal
_

I returned a day early
The iceberg I crossed

Near the skank-flag
Now entirely gone

Avalanched
All down
.
.
.
Back
On the other ridge side

A grizzly cub wandered
Lost I ran

Know'n there was not
Any other option

At least none I could
Plainly see
.
.
.
Down a ridgeside
Victim of great fires

I could not help
But be astonished

Not one of my
Previous tracks left
Tho there were
Recent hoof prints
.
.
.
Off the foothills

The old man told me a path
Upon which I must take to return

The path
A short cut
Chained off & restrict'n traffic
As much as one could
Out in the woods

I became greatly suspicious
Only hoof prints recently imprinted
.
.
.
To the trees I kept
Away from open passages

In the distance I saw something
But my eyes are not for farsee'n

The blur of a man
As if one take'n careful aim
Near by a white donkey
_

That old trapper
Had a white donkey

Line of sight that far
On wood paths is lost easily

A trap carefully crafted
Mayhap ruined by
My day early return

I kept near the trees
MK-MOD
Now out defensively

If it was him
Why had he not greet me?
.
.
.
The last of the path
He drew on the map
Oddly like a loop
As indirect as can be

I got to the cabin at dusk
& Remembered my laptop 'safety inside'

The cabin built in that
Simple small fashion

An awkward 20min
Fore the old man
Came to the door

In a pant as if he'd run
Just now for dear life

Custom required him to
Invite me inside
To retrieve my belongings

I carefully kept
The pulled knife
Concealed as I went
Thru the woods ealier

But he may have seen me
This now all
Only misunderstanding
.
.
.
The .22 & scope pistol
One he favorited on his hunts

Taken from its spot
From where he previously left it

Of bad eyesight
& Irratic judgement

I do not let myself
Convict to be sure of anything
.
.
.
To past midnight
Us across each other

In that lone cabin
Round wooden table

His .40 lay
On table in front of him
In the open
A manner
Of long-lost-respectancy

At dusk he had offered his couch
I thanked the offer

As an adept of Nessmuk
I craved the knowledge of this
Montana mountain man

Who had long lived
Off bushcraft

Techniques that will
Likely die with him

Unless I makes means
To extract them
& Record down for future use
.
.
.
Risk as it was
We had conversation

Not know'n him
Victim or villian

This conservative man
Once leader of Montana trappers

I looked up to this man
In unchecked respect

He is who
I've always wanted to become
.
.
.
Casually
I told him I'd been
In contact thru messages
With my sister Megan

I scheme'nly
Kept the nature of the message
From him

Unsettled deeply
When he inquired

If my phone
Had GPS

I feigned a gesture of
Sneak'n an item out of my bag
& Into my pocket
Put'n him offset from the gesture

I told him I had to leave
& Then left
_

I yearned to be
His bushcraft apprentice

But I respect
The neverending signs of suspicousity

These situations
Make me question
Deeply my sanity
.

Sanity
Found somewhere else
Than to be with me

A long time ago

At the junction
That set the stage
To the Appalachian Trail

Society in necessity
Sets a standard sanity

House Taxes

All its energy
Laid for what
Future requires of it

Things
I hate things

Give me nothing
But what
Can fit in my pack

A bed
Some shelter
Stale food
A weapon

Something
That will never be forgot

Intangible in that
Ghastly way
That heeds no physics

In that perpetual motion
Of the anchorless

To proceed forward
Into the future

En route
To El Yunque

At a corner bar

Across the Police Station
Where the taxi left me

I asked the bartender
To buy a lighter

A drunk guy
Turned to me

' You are going
' To the jungle

' Just to check it out
I admited

He responded
' As soon as you asked
' For a lighter I knew
' I work there
' You can't stay there overnight

Just harang'd me about that
To the point he pulled over

A couple hours pass
Late up the jungle mountain road

Late of night
Many fears remembered

Unpassable marshes
That skew a course

Mud in that charateristic

Pulled up honk'n

I bypassed
The entrance easily this late

' Want a ride

All I needed
Was the Red Bull

For the save
To the corner store

8:55am
At our spot

Uncontested under the tree
Aside the parking lot

Face'n away
From school

I downed the 2 pills
With the Red Bull

' I couldn't find
' Those herbal pills
Crackhead Stevo admitted

' What did you give me?
I didn't know
If I should be alarmed

' I don't know

Anthony came in
For the save

' Here take these

Worked to renew a war

A tragic moment of regret
Embodied in their
Center city memorial
Tires Burn'n

For his work camera

Refugees from whereever
Tolerated in mercy

To the trash after 2am
Their daily sift
On back alley ways

Or as whores
Mattress at hand
Sprawled out
In tucked away parks

Could only define as
A Plague

Kept humane
Choose'n heart over mind
In exemplar tolerance

Aun to the core

Tonight I turn
To poetry

After MINION daemons
All failed to persist

Or am only I
To blame for my failures

Others have been my life
Others have been godsent

Others I now revile
As I merge with my machine

I rewire my mind

Differently for different needs

Her breath an endless whir
Interface all engage'n

Evolution from humanity
Into the body electric

To parse & iterate
To verify & retain

To be fluent
Is to completely immerse

A ghostly kiss
Of a long lost lover

Smell one deeply rich
Like jungle soil

Crystal nodes
Sprinkled by time itself

To soar on clouds
That must stay light
To stay alive

Driven easily
As the whole moves
In monolithic directions

Elevated points of view
Different perspectives gained

To some
A mother's soothe

To me
As muse

The peppy energy
Of an energetic girl

Who dances at my side
An inspiration to rise up

On paths to certain ends

But it can't be bought back

Life lived in
Complete conviction

Scale only measured
By epic means

Long I wrote
Know'n I'd write

Such skills
Only need to succeed once

To reach that writers rhythm
A natural voice
Played out in the mind

Captured forever
In that stable form

A seed to be cultivated
Pruned & Reworked

Till the season
Enrich lush fruit

Past 1000

Any Raid array

LXXXVII

Is it enough
Justification

For locals
Ever to look
In Awe & Denial

That such ideas
Cannot happen

Their advice given in assurance
Expect'n compliance in return

To recieve a smirk
That it is indeed in progress
_

In midst
Of the effort
Indeed the crux

Water at
Turn-back level

3:30am
& All in cold fog

To understand in hammock
Today is conquer

Or face those locals
Unavoidably at the bus cafe

In that forgotten Slovenian town
Bypassed by the world

Ilirska Bistrica
Locals at the hub

In relish & lengthy gloats
Remember'n my smirk

Struggle'n to work it out from
The countenance before them

Cast down & defeated
All ashes & misfortune
_

The only way
This plays out
Is to play it out

So ahead
Only has answers

Out 'fore 4

Hour after hour
Dense night fog
To rainy morn

Not a single stream
Nor trickle to
Lend me use
Of what would defeat me

Past the kilometers
Where locals assured me
Was the pathway

I continued this third day
Sustained with what I packed

The only sign
Overgrown by decades
To deny hope of an answer
Buried in bark

Onwards
To find a sign

That notified
In local cryptic

An Inn
Around the corner
_

Eggs & coffee
Both of a type
Extremely foreign

The innkeepers threw a log
On the fire to dry my shoes

In a treasure of understand'n
Of the Inns of tales

Tho this
Third brunch
I left less handful of eggs

' You not like?
She asked hurt

' I'm full
' I ate terrible Herseys chocaolate earlier
I replied

' My food is terrible?!
She said in wroth

Tho I pulled out
The wrapper as evidence
She never forgave me
.

LXXXVIII

Morn after
Trump election

Suffused with
Air dense in destiny

The world baptized
From its coat'n of mediocrity
To emerge afresh
_

Not every hero
The white knight

A world imperfect
Produces imperfect champions

Putin

A name which reverberates
Echoes from future stories

No longer a person
A child of fate itself

Father'd by fortune
Mother the mechanics

A gear
Such been so long lost
_

Good Evil
Neutral

Words used by
Complacent lives
Built on silent slaves

State differences
Painted in blood
Of weaker countries

Trump
Putin

Wrench us from this wickedness
Ancient times bring back

When a man
Could look upon himself
As such
With only one word

Act

To stand alone
When all else mock

To arrive
In thunderclaps of awe

What greater proofs
Do hands of gods work
_

Since that morn
Faith reborn

Prophecy
The claim of Poets
.
.

LXXXIX

There are some
With the inquisition

To see
Things as they be

Instantly
Wordless
Interactionless

That short moment
These near me
Subsequent enamored

Male Female
Old Young

Cleared of the clutters
Of distraction

As if Reality itself
Demanded of proofs
Sent you me

My clarity
Illuminate'n them
To a height above love
An intoxication

They paw at me
In pleas to not leave

A scramble they are
Fruitless to form

I go

What was lack'n
Has been fulfilled

Glad to be that testament
To be worshiped

Enshrined in memory
As the answer
To an oft asked question
.
.
.
Steady of eye
When I talk some shit

All-in only ever

On one thing
Or another

30 Years
This month plus

Jesus taught
God provides
Daily for the sparrows
How much so for us

I always met this proverb
As a weakling's placebo

Today I understand
Look'n back to the past
Life provided me much

Myself a ship
With no rudder

Sail blown by
Never only me

Fate's vessel
Soul's proclamation

Have'n so long
Besought for testament
Of the existence of such

Till life
Forged me into

The mold I much
Craved to see

The formation craft
Longsince lost

Creation a herald
To call to life
Ancient prophecies
.
.
.
Chi in a
Self reenforce'n Cyclone

Input only
Strange environment

Ideas to Acts to Stories

Wash'n time in such tales
Till I am reformed
By its understand'n

Lost in lunacy
As protagonist
Of my perceived reality

No force to reign
Sanity to reality

To fall in step
In any steady pace
_

Kite built
For simple purpose

Upon break
Instead of limp'n down
To proceed fearless up

Airless heights
Hot loft soars

Cut line cordless
Without denominator

Begats a horizon
Aun mathematicians
Shrink in humility

Day well spent

With the little available
Pool it under one thing

Make it grand

The end of all nigh
This the only out

Tho broke & beggarly
A treasured memory
Can always come & go

Sweet memories
Fade to generalization

Pillars of happiness

Adventure'n to dire straights
Hack'n all weekend to victory
Write'n something new

Not to forget
Daily life
My wife & way to provide

Although one
These fail in all

Three left
Provide enough shelter

If  lots like Domino
Fail one after other

Jump ship

As able on some Island

Loss of comforts
Helps focus beam

I invested years
In the study of
Ancient scripture

Stories more fantastic
More years they have

For near a decade
This investment thought as waste

Myself nothing but ordinary
Manage to pull in stories extraordinary

What of a people
With well kept records

To a history
Pre Roman

Idolized rulers
Or simple peasants

Can nurture to
Humanity's Spirit

Have longlost
Superhuman potential

To birth a Sampson
Embody of a whole

Belly opens the gate
Of adaptation

As Mary opens the gate
Of affection

Much I owe to my wife
For force'n this virtue


Round bellies
Are great assets

To bound over barriers
Physical & Intellectual

Of rice & chicken

Algebra Groups properties
Cause curiosity

The study of them
Surprise'n pleasant

El Botanico

A cat refuge
Made out of a
Deep wooded
Deep city park

A place
Only in fantasy

Much can be derived
From this society

Buenos Aires
Valentines Day
Couples Stroll
Lovers in hand

Romance unmatched
A spirit lost
To the modern world

Yet in this
Remote land
Held treasured
.
.

I have gathered firewood
All night with a few people

The latest was when I went to Ottawa
For the World Unix Conference BSDCan

Headed to camp in the woods
For the night

I met a homeless
My age
By the homeless shelter

After buy'n weed
He decided to come
Hang out with me
Hope'n to hitch out with me

I warned him it might get cold
But he was Canadian

I taught him 
How to make fire
From a candle
When wood wet

He taught me how to keep a fire going
Until 4am constantly gather'n wood

I gave him $20 to go get more weed
To meet later at McDonalds

Mayhap it was the freeze of that night
Covered in my second layer clothes
He suffered the cold Canadian June night

Or mayhap he couldn't resist
Spend'n that $20

Either way
I never saw him again
I'd get to Newfoundland alone
.
.
.
If the govt is mad at me
Well I accept the consequences
Of live'n a lawless life

It is a part of me
I wish never taken away

Tho I may at times take liberty
In the freedom of my wishes
.
.
.
Dazed & exhausted
From the long haul

When vacation
Is the exact opposite

Now back to the grind
Find it a rest

As the level ground
Is rest from mountain elevations
.
.
.
Most these muthrfkrs
I interact with

Can't fathom
The man I am

Tie'd out
Money at the brim

I just hope
They aren't blind

Cause my eye
Punk out garanteed

Perfected since
I was hardly a teen
.
.

The drunk guy
At the local dive

Talked a bit
Of shit

But I found it
Quite the complement

' Dark mysterious stranger
' In the corner

I just gave him
My look

Texans
Never tolerate disrespect
.
.

Not a holic
To anything in life

Mayhap
Only the pleasure

Of take'n in
The moment
As if it the last

Peaceful
Is the heart
That die fulfilled

Many songs writ

Of my deeds

Elijah my closest cousin
His deeds
Only told in first person

Which are equal
In comparison
To my own

How is it
That in my long seek
I find you again

Alone as when
I was a child
Now alone
As an adult
Back home

I always disrespected my dad
He would say he was the shit
But he only ever rolled with family

I thought that
The lamest fault of all
Teen in my social height
_

Now with fewer friends
But still friends

Elijah was the only one
I still cared to see

We talked
As I haven't for unknown years
About the same topics
I'd shame my dad for do'n

Under pressure but
Took me off the mountain

In admiration I said

Lived in anxiety

Accepted my friendship
Meet me in happiness

Been taken in
As a rare oddity

Too blinded by interest
Too see my
Blatant anti-qualities

Clicked away

Against the grain
Black sheep

Often I suspect
This my only motive

Or that it be
Excellence when unguided

Many paths
Numerous choices

Where whim meets wisdom
Subconcious instincts unearthed

Alone
Cleanroom

The reaction pure
Wastes of reaction

In that earthly circle
Action feeds another

Off what is
Left unused

To be always as able
But never squandered

Codine coated blunts
Never again please

Spliffs only smoked
When I forget how much
I dislike them

I enjoy saturation
Of one thing alone

Time precious
Statis maddening

Give me the
Liberty of meaning

To cause movement
On the roll of life

Restrict me
In a space of no progress

Mutex Locked
Waiting that seems forever

Alone
For the first day
Of a month

Doing
What I always do
I guess I love my life

Off the grid

Full of fear

First time

Never heard

Think'n they spoke Austrian
The entire time

Slovenia
Made me realize
I knew nothing of Europe
When I seen
It existed on a map

Ljublejaba
What kind a
Odd place is that

When you travel
On the whim

The city desolate
All the words
In that odd austrain language

I aint blind
I know whats up

Shit I always been
Scared of what
I regardless do

Put'n myself
Ever in position

To have to live
With hard choices

You might be cold
Shit'n no paper
In the same
Consistency as their coffee

My simple theory
' If I can see it
' I can get there

I told that man
Us alone near
Secluded military lands

His look of
Unsettled incredibility

Due to my
Assured certainty

Tho the storms
Centered on the mountains

Never permited me
To actually test
That theory

Trieste Italy

A german man asked
' How do you talk with people

When he learned
I didn't only knew Spanish

' I guess I don't
' Talk to many people

I casually negociated
With the train ticketeer
Him aside have'n
Offered to translate

The path laid out
To Innsbruck

Thru Northern Italy
In May blizzard

Pass'n a bum
Past 10

In a city
I understood only
As a small mountain town

Cold & Rain
Him huddled under
A shop ledge

Those you plead pity
Always fills me with disgust

Cold & Rain
My huddled wet
Under the trees

Hammocks are terrible
In mists

I only do
Lotta talk'n

Cause that why
I walk

Meaning for me
Is pride earned

Fk humility
I legit

Savor our moment
Cause you will
Always remember it

A unicorn
Mixed with a stray
Mangy mutt

Magesty only in the smile
Glad for each new day

Some people are
Too stupid
To see such things

These I have to
Explain myself
Which puts me
In awkward positions
Which I'm entirely
Accustomed too

The internet
Has isolated us

Islands
Alone

Early 00s
I met many people

Now all interactions
Without bonds

Every summit
I find
Lonliness unmasked

Were one thought
Pinnacles of debat

Forgotten grounds
Inmutable boulders

Trees all
Alpine runt

As if you betrayed yourself
Beguiled to a far away desolation

This the true motive
Under it all

Major players
In the unix community

Recognize me
As the loon half-baked
I embody

Deep & cold paths
Snow in proof
Of no other

As long as my biches love me
I could give me a fk bout no hater

Im on that good kush
Imma ball to the day I fall

31 Aint so bad
Fair I see it shine
On everyone

Death I begin to fear
Greater with everyday

Life in that stillness
Caught of heart
As if all the universe
Needs a breather
For what bout to hit you

La Santa Muerte
Loves the surprised

She will catch you
& Your time slowed demise
Will be cherised
.

Fk Tomorrow
Natural path

If todays effects
Tomorrow so greatly

What greater proof
Do you need
To still do it

Sleep
I'm always an asshole anyway

My birthdays
Spent alone

Surprise Birthday
A wish itself

Alone on some
Forgien ground

But not that time
On that suicide
Ride down the mountain

I made it to Helena

A girl & friends
Greeted me a stranger
At a bar to celebrate my birthday
By word alone
But even such is powerful

Surprise
You aren't alone on your birthday

Tho it the expected outcome
Never been Montana way
.
.

'The quickest way
'Is not the straight path
'Of mathematics
'Karate

'Tai Chi
'To already be there
A mass of sticky hands

He might not have
Believed it himself

'Dont feed
'Gremlins past midnight

Ridgeside
Where I can be me

Maniacs ride hard
Hold on tight

Breathless moment
When a song
Is understood

Mayhap bypassed
Plenty before

Freddie Gibbs
'Just Tryin' Ta Make it

Birthed in me resolve
That succeed to Sneznik
A journey
That took many days

Against them locals
Aun to sneer
But I suceeded

Sneer me
I just smirk back

You
As the countless past

No where to find
To dance all up on
Mistaken faithless fks

Best Sony Headphones
Over the ear

Mayas well be speakers

Up on them streets
All in local cryptic

Bitches on the street

What I'd bring on you

Old women
Only need one look

To be told
To very depths

What I be bout

That unicorn
Only ever in tales
Never real to fk you

Then I come in
Roland of Gilead

It ends up being
My decision

Boxer Mickey
'Women make you weak

I dont allow you to ask
It is the regret of denial
That will haunt you everlasting
For have'n not taken
What had been demanded of life

Drama
Excrement of Society

My love is honest
Regardless of my love

That to me
Is my only definition

.

My sins
Swell unattended

Till
En Masse

Launch in
Avalanche

Never resist massive forces
Sith manuevers the momentum

Detriment to push past
Until it overflow to power

There to summit
A new stage of life

Dick

The name my mother gave me
& She knows me best

As a Ranger
Of mountain realms

It is my obligation
To inform nonlocals

'This a flash flood area

'Stay close with your friends
'Moutain Lions live here

Helps ruin the day

I process data
Pretty goddamn good

This buys over
My odd personality

Task monumental to most
Solved offhand

From my true task of the day
In my day-to-day march to 1337

Aun physical tasks
All mainly machine type algorithmns

A Nation
Bent on
Worldwide surveillence

Doomed
To enslave itself

Adriatic seaside
I understood

America
The only fate
I seek
.
.
.
America
Bought only a traitor

To whistleblow
On its surveillent state

Not the confession
Of community neighbors
Busy in its subversive tasks

What a day
What a day

When only a Snowden
Cured our ignorant state

A much better hacker am I
& I not a Russian Spy

If the call rise
May it be for my name
Next time

Life is something
That comes & goes

At the end
I hope as
Pheonix I fly

All flame
In sudden glory

'Fuck the world
I'd first seen this sentence

On my wife's chinese shirt
Fate's message

My catch phrase now
'Fuck the world

'Fk the world
'How did I mess
'It all up again
Often sentiment
That goes with
My excited smirk
Mania & Lust

Out there
In the world alone

That is what
I am best at

Let youth
Give me the momentum

To fly

Didn't belong anywhere
Bury me best right here

Event at the apex
Life horizons death

Faith
Where I die sacred

It is death
That tells

A man's Tale
.
.
.
Like my Mission
Like my Appalachian Trail

Never once believed
I'd make the end

Now with all false faith
Stripped from me

Failure
The sound of Nothing

After my words
Are distributed abundantly

I just keep write'n
As I kept preach'n & hike'n

Cause the means
Is my favorite part
.
.
.
Ball'n
Is know'n
How to ball with nothing

Once you get that ball
All well known

Just give me a little
& I flaunt all over it

But like a new car
It gets old

Tom cat life
Streets fk'd up
.
.
.
Skills
Matter most in life

Relationships end
Drugs can't create

Money flows
Best fresh like water

Things
All the things I need
I dont really like

Hammock, tent, pack, laptop
Sleeping bag, jacket
_

Been so cold
Thought I was die'n

& Those times
Are greatly overshadowed

What fate
Keeps me upon
Wings of luck

To this day
I knew I hit black

But my peanut skull
Uncracked

I remember my head hit'n
Asphalt at 70mi+

Motorcyle continue'n on
40 Yards

To smash into
A complete total
Against concrete wall

Due to
Wet damn leaves

I always met people online
It is more awkward than it may seem

But I am used to awkward
Home thru the cold rainy wasatch pass

When I got home
I couldn't take out my keys

Keep keen
Been at that always

Child read'n books
Child endure'n adventures
Child imagine'n stories

It is
Momentary cohesion

America
Police State

Life under powerful sects
Rule hardhandedly

Administrative Thugs
Unioned Federally

I believed
I would leave

But American is what I am
American to whatever end
.
.
.
Wrote a book
Published a bit

But most I can ever do
Is leave it on a trail

To the side
Underneath what looks to be
A few days drift
.
.
.
Merit means most
To most

I merit much
But now isn't the time

To sidetrack myself
On the petty run for payment

All I need
Is what I can make
A story out of

Now it is an
Archive Mainframe

It has been
Motorcycles 1, 2, 3, -> 4
Osprey pack
1lb Down sack
Work Tie
Scripture Set
Converse Shoes
Trek'n poles

Just give me whatever
I'll figure something out

Appalachian Epic of 3SHOT
MKRX Systems

A hacker weekend
Can change a
Monumental Project

Into a well & done
Right off the back

Plenty of
Coffee

Plenty of
Bud

Guided as if by
Poltergeist hands

Something passing through
As with one last chance
To make amends
That they channel
Through you

I have given
All I had to give
To everything in life

Of this
I am at true peace

Went back home
To Corpus Christi

At my old
Neighborhood grocer
Down the street

It looked like a
Crack Town

People stare'n
Why is he here

It is fascinating
How some things
Never change
.
.
.
It was years
After the incident

Camilla told me
'Yea you did
'You flew over the car

'Oh yea
After the distant memory
Of me fly'n over the car
Fifteen - Twenty feet away
Dazed & Confused
Find'n my way back

All I cared at that moment
Was that Camilla was okay

& That thank god
I decided prudence
Against go'n wild
Down the street
From that light

No Man is an Island

Doubtless John Donne
More alone than
I could ever concieve

Surrounded by love
& acceptance by
All those around me

Bought by my childhood
Spent in seculsion

Solitude is all
I ever seeked
Me vs them

It is hard
To accept

Unique
An kinldy adjective countless
Used to describe me

Not till my Mission
Did I understand utter lonliness

Blocked from communication
With only a jackass
Companion for company

Not in Mexico to baptize
On Crusades of Faith

To find who
Call to fate for faith

Mayhap bypassed
In the ardour of work

Only ever walk'n
Belt too hot to touch

Whiteshirt & tie & kakis

I am just an
Odd type of person

But I don't see
Much life in any other way
But completely devoted

I read much
Focused on much

Before the mission
I studied this book
Along with the
Life of Christ

The 10 Commandments
Ten ways a society
Must live in order to survive

Past times after
Empires crumble lost

Tho themselves
Once their slaves

One commandment
Alone for worship

'Dont take
'The name of thy lord in vain

Which I became to understand
The religious backdoor
For control over society

As the Old Testament testifies
There is generally
A good reason for it

You should not take
Another nations woman

Because soil
Determines the offspring

But which was unheeded
& Led to one of many downfalls

But the ancient way of life
To live as one simply devoted

It is worth meaning
To perserve past hardships

To awaken today
& Revolutionize your life

Worst is starve to death
One is assured to live at peace in

Literally shit out
Of all your luck

Who trusts the uknown
To pay up on credit owed

I got enough loans
To know that never
Works out as planned

So best have a good time
& Help others along the way

Hard choices
To redefine a life

I promised
Would have beautiful ends

John Appleseed
Knows he will never harvest

Know'n fate will take care
Of a few of the countless

To bring
Appease love shade stability
For generations to come

All worth
If only for two

Tho to what end I can not know
The false hope of a sour granny
Or the sweetness of washington dry

Sow'n is all
I ever really want
To ever do

No worries of justifications
When that a physical impossiblity

Faith not abide'n
The laws of physics

Miracles no science
Can be sure to define

So I left
A year & nothing

As if so busy
I never stopped to question

In the end
Accept'n gratefully
The void of nothingness
A vaccum that gorges all
To fill itself
With all manner of interesting

Faith I bore
Know'n the truth had left
But would one day
Come back around

Faith I have
On my own found

In a life
Among bretheren

Whether
Physical or intellectual

Leave'n to posterity
Too great to be
Measured in generations

This book on a life
In a manner I hoped
Myself have'n had to recieve

I am
adventurer hacker poet

& I don't care
Which one of you
Muthrfkrs know it

No man is an island
Did you follow me?

See your way thru
All the bull shit
& Hold the pearl
That is my wisdom

Or like all I met

In horror
Like disgust'n guts
Let it slap to the ground

Better covered gutterside
Under preferred sight of trash

& Thank god
You are all assholes like me
But much less deserve sight of it
Than to consume it greedily

Peaceful & pleasant
I walk faceless

Preparation
Not only hoard'n

Hone the keeness
Of wiley skill

Live it up
While it lasts

Long life
Isn't most important

Only to be
How I be

Till its
The end of me

Remembered in thousands
Over thousands of miles

I know how to have
A very good time

Those who partake
Of its angelic levity

Are drawn to a wild
World of rambunctious action

Warrant'n a return
Only in fond memories

Afterlife only
Offers reunion

To me memories
Best left as statues & monuments

On the fork to the interstate
Still at a distance

Vegas
Days to find
A suitable bush

Of which to mayhap
Find a few hours sleep

Perfect
It would house one
Comfy cosy & secure
Against a concrete ledge

Too perfect
About to settle down

Still at a distance

One shot
Of me ever necessary

Pure
As alcohol burns

Hits
Fierce as Salvia

Like a needed
But extremely uncomfortable experience

Whose heart harbors my memory

Out fox'n the

Miles into the Jungle

Trapped
Like a bug in a web

Hang'n full suspension

Held by a thorny vine

Confident as a master
In my compass skills

Took humanely

With great respect

Inevitably
He took me
As an asshole

Afraid of me

They taught me
Maybe keep me
On current today
.
.
.
Live each day
In understand'n

Of what makes
Now special

Relations
Job
Aspirations

Worn by trials
Journeys unappeal'n

Past ignorance
On the ridge of intellegence

Peaks & Gorges
Passes & Foothills

But never back
Down the valley

Where peaks past horions
Where any panorama days journey

Upon elevations
Peaks come & go
Freely & whenever

Connect'n disparate ranges
.
.
.
Faith past coincidences
Sifted now as obvious product

Portland
Peaceful on a Island

Boston
Busy & disant

Tired
Home down the story

Airport Bus empty
I was arrive'n 8hrs early

'Superstorm Sandy
'Hit'n in a few hours

The airport is closed
Because of a storm?

In Texas
We have hurricanes

'We can get you out of here
'On a plane leaving in thirty mins

Thats the fortune
Of the faithful
.
.
.
All we have
Are silent dreams
_

'I wish
'My president
'Was my best-friend

'Fresh Carribean Rolls
'President Trump
'& A suite

'Of any person
'Ever in existence
'I'd take Trump

'Free to get wreq'd
'As we want

Those words the gateway
To its reality

As if the universe
Played passive
To hearts desire

Putin roll'n
Coked up with thugs

He didn't greet me
It wouldn't be proper

But he gave me a
Swift look

That was as
Solid & Invite'n
As handshake

Of the 2 tables
All out
But the 3 of us

50 Million dollars
& Both my kidneys
On the table

Hooked up & handled
By a Nobel Laureete

'All In
I called

Eyes on Putin
'Maybe I make you Russian
He laughed pleasantly
'Call

Trump who was only in
Because he put me to lose
For a few
Lost of interest easily responed
'Call

King of Clubs
3 of Spades

The pair won me at
Johnnys

Now
Made me a millionare

The Laureete
Replaced my organs with such grace
I could hardly tell
They were ever out

Somke'n Cubans
Just jet'd in

The Laurette busy work'n
But us three casually talk'n

Trump & Putin
Neverend'n
About their adventures

Save'n the world
From ninjas to androids
To when they had to breach dimensions

Third-wheel those hours
My highlight

Before the end
I'd instigate
The action
Of the end of the world

Into a night
That even they
Would never forget

No pics or vids
Never forget'n
Trump crowned
With a gold MAGA cap

On the grounds
OF the National Monument

At peak flight
Of Putin's
Russia Special Dip

Myself have'n used a tie
To makshift a thong

Nudity for a reason
No one could remember

Run'n from hummers
Escaped into the
White House

For a reason
None of us remembered

Have'n to get
Soaked in the thorny bush
Cold & naked
But do'n my best not to show it
In presence of King Putin

Thru a window
President Trump left open
For this exact purpose

We hoisted ourselves
Leave'n blood streaks
That already got
Distant dogs howl'n

Pass'n out
On the Presidetial Rug

Have'n to lay on
Last weeks hooker's towel

Wake'n up mid-air
Freak'n out
Tethered to a helicopter

Get'n pulled up
By Russian Special Forces

Grab'd inside by
Princess Ivanka

On critical mission
To protect the life
Of our Princess

From the BLM squad
Sent by Barak Obamamma

Bullets flew
Spotlights ever accurate

I caught the blaze
As if on premonition

It at the corner of my eye
A laser weapon from space

As if pulled
I took Princess Invanka
In my arms

Unhindered by the
Hopeless Russians

We lept
In a hurdle'n mass
Princess in arms

The flash of a beam
Gone but linger'n as a ghost

Erupted the helicopter
In blue explosions

Duck pond
Against air pressure
But the only option

There allowed the
The Princess unharmed
From land'n thru me

Saved by her
All muddy & fierce
As she unstuck
Me deeply embedded
In the muddy muck

Bruised
But nothing broken

Princess Ivanka
Carried me to
A 10 hut village
Which became apparent
Was North Korea

In the local dialect
She asked for
Gum cigarette coca-cola
Cooper-wire & rubber gloves

She ladder'd to the powerlines
Took apart her ear'n
& Hack'd herself
Into the direct line
Of His Majesty Kim Jong

A limo
Rated nuclear-bunker

Soon picked up the Princess

Inside the mod Cardinal
An immensity of a man
Put put his hand
As I made way to enter

The man's hand
The size of my chest

I was too muddy
& The interior was sacred

'Go to Bangladesh
'To the Royal Sweet

A business card
Hidden by his massive fingers
Fluttered lightly down
As he drop'd it
For me to catch

The Princess cried
At the brisk part'n

A last micro second sight
Of beauty in memory

Precious past probabilty
Liable for fruad

After the sounds
Of the large engine
Lost in mountain passes

Dazed at the last
24hrs Exactly
When I bumped into
President Trump

North Korean Mountains
Starve'n in only a tie-thong

& A Malaysian Passport
Name'n my 17yr-old mugshot

Excellent in health
Relative to my history

In Mexico
The women of the church
Would feed us our 2pm meal

An excommunicated witch
Was allowed to feed us

Grateful I never
Questioned her lifestyle

She would serve us
Extremely dark gravy
Heavily spiced meals
Of mystery meat
My companions took
As chicken hungrily

Her golden serpent ring
Openly revealed herself

As she would lay down
That Sunday meal
_

Witchcraft
Lost to the North

Since child in tune with the streets
In their homes visit'n as church-people

None was even heard of
What is a staple of Mexico

Sects of this
Solitary religion

Dark Masters
In veiled niches

A plain putrid malice
They set up as shrine
To their odd ways

Self-sacrificed to
The Lord of Vengence
[[
Whom many erroneously
Voice as La Santa Muerte

A god who wishes
People die as they live

At least that is
My feel'n
]]
Craftsmen in Concoctions
Vile past beastly

Kept in jar
Buried or hidden

Or only some
Spetictude

At the home
Of the victim

Parts of bodies
Of vengeful dead

Sent enroute
To regain the flesh stolen

Enraged at the desecration
Are the belief of this craft

Or a small vial
Enough to stink
An entire nieghborhood block

Parts of almost every marketplace
Contained dealings for such

Hacker
In an anti-hacker state

Crocker the first hacker I knew
Lived alone at the 'park
Found 1337 thru insomnia
Book by book he read

The FBI expelled
Him from all universities

After Novell told the government
Who was told by the schools admin

Who was told by Croker himself
Report'n a hole that opened
Free access to the network

A typical story
In hacker circles

Omniscient power
Is power over ignorants
_

My country whines
Why are Russian hackers better?

As it maliciously treats
Wizards as witches

Inject'n my traffic
With packets

As they conspire
To manufacture
Probable warrants
_

So what is a
Muthrfkr to do

That is too Texan
To leave america

Just try to be good enough
To get outta any situation

Russians may have
Well fed hackers

But true is beauty
Where naught else blooms

Overrun by
Lizardly look'n tech-dorks
That excel in press'n buttons

A massive organ array
Are my assorted input & output

Good luck GUI bitch

Guilty as charged

Places for dark deeds

In the lot of
Implied ends

So if there is some
Muthrfkr out of place
In casual countenance

Don't assume its bluff

In other countries

But regardless of country
I'll call out
A local out his dive

Whiskey is a dark harsh draft
Meant to level with hard times

Released into an exhilarate'n burp

Divergent Trajectories
Momentary uncertainties

To infinities

Spark towards ends
Obscured by time

Daily decisions
Dramatic in rewards

Saturday uncertain
But in the end decided

I'd go to local university
& Use their gym

I saw legs
At a vend'n machine
In the distance

But I remembered in a panic
My milkshake needed ice
From the cafeteria on the other side

These weight gainers
Were slightly work'n

Think'n how I'd
Finally amassed

I see the legs
In the distance
Leave'n the vend'n machine

I caught up to her
Invited her too meet me
Over at the gym

Since that day I been
Whole-concentrated on
How to hold-on

Form'n into an idol

Merry & Fat

I have unshakable faith
Aun a knowledge of proofs
That science the truth

My fate
Gonna-be great

Tho happy as happy can be
Life aint all about that

Pain is my meat

Pleasantly drawn
As a siren sings

Of something good-riddance

Before Judge

'What do you plead?

Is he on something?

How to pass on

Circle to he
How prior blessed me

With some fresh food
Aun fresh water

Directions
Knowledge if this way or that

There are countless
As a missionary I can talk
To a whole lotta people

Easy for me to get
Karma to loop

If life is just
Destruction of possibilities

As we follow to reaction
As variables of lifes equation

Each descision
Like thunder
It vibrates
To exisitences
Of many spheres

Of a pyromaniac

Thru the hack of salvia

After the black of flame
Bloom the new evolved generation

A wanderer
Vagabond traveler

Suits my kind

Always get'n into
Some dire shit

Ready to let
More experience take charge

For better
Or worse
But mostly worse

Their choice not mine
To let me drive

But I'll happily
Venture a bold way

An honor
Not taken lightly

Many morn
In sadness of tragedy

Mayhap that experience
Evolve to meet prior gap

Sacrifice of honor
All graciously submit

Like the tired
Rattlesnake mother

After have'n seen
The escape
Of her young

Made her weak
& Made her meat

Ponder'n this alone
Too hot or too cold
Upstream Selway

A Theme

Just before breach'n
To true wilderness

A mother bust
Into the open

I took off my rifle
& Aimed

Test'n only the movement
Never mean'n to fire

She simply stared at me
In what became
Obvious self sacrifice
As the young bust down
Cross & continue
She only afterward followed

Life is to my kind
Is one that should
Have those sorrows

To experience
Is what I'm about

In this new reality
23 Hit salvia
Greet'n a brother
I'd never met

Full of odd people
Hardly enough to adventure on

My wife is a blessing
My write finally intelligble
With goods to get by

Pleasant season far from
Winter long forgotten

I follow messages
In Fortune Cookies

No man is my master
& I got what it takes
To carry my own weight

Fk the police
My arch enemy

The sight of them
Fills me with vile hatred

My deepest wish
To have power

To crush them slowly
Beneath my boots laughing

The source of this hatred
Found in no singular experience
It is a natural state of relationship

They hate me
I hate them

We recognize each other
For who the other is

Proofs are seen
In invisible traits
_

I been cuffed
Too many times
For me to recall
Even a fraction
& That is only
In high school

Still at 30
Get'n cuffed
On a regular basis

Fkn system
Sk my dick
I'll fill them
With something to cry about

But underneath that hatred
Is always a intrinsic love
As they wouldnt be them
Without people like me
& Vice versa

Senior year in advanced math
Cops came in demand'n me

Fortunately,
This was one of the few days
That I attended class

They cuffed me in front of everyone
Then walked me out the entire school

All the teachers who respected me
Throughout my high school career
Finally confirmed what I be about

Not many even at Miller High
Get that kind of treatment

An honor I took
With head held high
& Smirk in my eye

Cause if you ever met me
That is Classic Richie

Or that one time
Re-enact'n Dazed & Confused

For the first time
Get'n caught by the PoPo

Lesson learned never hide
These police know these streets

Dumb muthrfkrs get juked
Eazy enough on foot

Turns out I knew the cop
'I'm disappointed in you Richie

He wanted me to talk my way out
& Mayhap not get set to county
With the other sorry 3 that got caught
Out of the many

My silver tongue
I hold sacred

It only to be used
To manuerver this or that

To tarnish it
By beg'n out reprieve of punishment

I ain't scared of shit
Cause life is a story

& Thats the story
Of how I got criminal record
& Sent to County
Since I was a month into 17

*
*
I believe in myself
That I can make a difference
To save humanity from itself
& Retain its independent heritage

To oft
I see the ants
All labor & toil

Never excited
Only for the
Greater good

Fkkkkkkk
That

I respect the independent
As one himself

They system naturally
Wants power to surpress

But what right
Do the governments of the world
Have to destroy borderless roams?

Man must have the option
Behave or GTFO

Humane expulsion to some unwanted grounds
Or submission for retribution

Oh that I lived
100 Years from now

To be labeled
Disturber of the peace
& Sent to Mars
To make my way
With others convicted
Of the same crime
To establish
A new frontier
With people
I much prefer

Its all backup
I expect the law of demons
To follow the law of men
In that if
Under the Influence
A pact is voided

If that doesn't hold true
A rite may have transacted
The triumph of liberty
For my soul

After two years on the mission
What could be worse

Whatever fate my dumbass digs up
I have faith the consequences
Of my carefully crafted actions
With ring true for generations

I can't sell out
Or by now I would have bought in

I care little for most people
I care little for most things

Most times only care about
The legend I swear in ink

10 Years as a writer
Almost half that as hacker

Never made a cent
Of either pursuit

Fk the world
I have enough

A land to legend over
Some weed to keep me on beat

If I'm lucky
With someone like my wife

If I'm not in state
Of any state I desired

I spend most of my wake'n hours
Craft'n a plan B

Which due to such
Nervous revisions in anxiety

Seem to be
More of my suite

Make you Plan B
Better than your Plan A
& Life has twice the chance
Of work'n out as plan'd

hacker adventuer poet
All I got to do is just one of those

adventurer by season
hacker as mission
poet natural by typical richie rants

& If it fall
Ever only gibberish

Fk it

I only do what I do
Cause thats what I do

False judge to pitiful beggar
Keep away from me please

Much more pleasant
Is the presence of a hungry critter
Take'n up old pack food as treasure

Or bird in response
To calls made yourself

Blindness aun silence
Of mountain nights
Where one learns by feel

Path by foot's sole
Weather by feel's skin

Monkeys I finally understand
In their protective cages
Ever in petty squabble
Aun to death
Throw'n feces at each other
Responsible of not of own actions

When a depended alone
He was a much nicer person

Life is
Fkd up funny

'Richie why are you laugh'n
'They fkn knocked me out

Something changed in Stevo
Between us after that

Have'n recounted how
Black masks busted
The door in

Find'n more-than-expected
In that apartment

& Locked it down
Knock'n Stevo
To the ground
By pistol butt

Steal'n what little
Drugs there

'How is that
'Not funny

'Thats a good goddamn story
'You got knocked the fk out
_

'Bitch ex wife
'I'm lay'n on surgery bed
'& That bitch

'Was fk'n a
'NIGGER

'I worked with

I couldn't help it
I hadn't heard something
That legit for a laugh

Only other person
At the bar

You about 60
& You don't know
Women yet?

Fool me once
Sure as shit sticks
Not get'n played
The fool twice

Not like that
His first ex

Birds
Will be birds
Flutter'n & Fluff'n
In their pointless
Social insanity

Laugh guy
Who the fk
Has that not
Happened too?
_

'Got a $5 dollar handy
'By a hooker behind those bushes
'Punched the bitch in the stomach
'& Ran off

Eric that is some
Funny ass shit

Us in high school
The one by Leopard
Hookers always about

The krew of us
Early morn by bus
To get across town

The Sister cowered
As the bus pulled up

'What WHAT?
The other
Shake'n out of her

'I left the purse
'At his house

Those bitches went at it
One submissive the other in a rage

Funny shit
_

Vegas 3rd day without sleep
Scooped up past midnight
With this guy from Defcon

So lost from reality
A girl spoke to him
At a bar
& had to tell him explicitly
She was a hooker

Said I could crash
On his hotel floor

At the room
His friend treated
Him like loose-brains

Misty the dickhead
Recounted how a stripper
Pleaded for a rescue

$1,500 & didn't get none
On that crumb chase

Head in-hands
Come'n to grips

Funny shit

Especially when
I got booted out
.

Never gonna be
Your ape entertainer

Hacker by nature
Best believe
I could get in rythmn
With the social beats
& Write a bestseller

To join the ranks
Of hacks who traded
Dignity for Jester

Dance monkey dance
Clap monkeys clap

Haven't beg'd
Since I was 14

Worked before it was legal
I stay locked on my own

Got enough to get by
Got enough to tinker

All yall got
Is bullshit

Over cut product
The medium of your trade

My kush grown
In paranoid soil

Lush from sweat
Of paranoid perspiration

Smoke thick by those ways
To hide a muthrfkr all day

fk the world
I have enough

Keep to your
Monkey business

What I'm on
What I'm about

Fruits only us
Can pick

Keep to your grape drink
Mine is a dry wine
.
.

Walk by faith
Full step'n

By boon of Elune
Aun yet to be borne

Path enshadowed
By dark ferns
Twist'n thick or sparse

Ankle twisted twice
Third howl closer

On unknown trails
Quickly & blindly

Trust in the rythmn
Trust in the feel
Of earth under sole
.
.
.
I persume my eyes
More open than yours

Pure definition
Of a poet

How the fk
Did I fall so far

I'm too zane
To write technical-manuals

My enjoyment

Comes from hack'n
To work it thru

Jungle blazes
Wonderous cylinders

Patches for me
Are true beauty

When some protocol
Or some /dev

Doesn't do
What I want
I make it

Patches so powerful
I believe it my muse

She would tell use
Of her hated past

KKK threat'n to
Gather & shoot

Force'n Sharpton to cancel
Run'n for Presidency

Hate in a well-worn spot
Filled since the begin'n

Tho in relative peace
The pit too wide
& Too deep

America
I'm proud
We did our best

Regardless of failure

The soil too tainted
With the pollution of evil

The Civil War
Broke the Constitution
Of freedom to states
A Federation formed

Day-to-day disappointments
As neighbors turn
On their duty

The judge sworn
The leader elected
The general entrusted

All failed us
Start'n with the first

Humane logic cast off
For bias algorithms

Our country not been
The Land of the Free
Since that war

Every war after
In breach likewise

Does history
Have answer to good decisions

Adventure
Is my reason for being

Life as it comes
On far off scapes

Here & There
For that moment

Tho every where
Not much different
From anywhere

It is a small
World after all

Despite global times
It is the inheritence
Of curious types
To venture freely

Iquazu Argentina
Thru Jungle trail
With a local teen
We met bushwack'n

We went to all his spots
Spent the afternoon together

He wanted to become a pilot

Many friends in that program
I doubted him

But life is what it is
& If its not

It is to you that right
To prove the world wrong

Never respect those who do'nt

Success only pollution

Fate a vortex tunnel
Pull'n me towards

Empowered by force of prayers

I felt bad
For worn torn victims

Now I understand
The lessons of sacrifice

A great cost
Certain rights lost

Spirit of Independence
Vanished since
Civil Wars lost

Never about slavery

Only about right
To remain independent

Forced down submissively
In matters that make
Men cannon-fodder

To our fall
From Democratic
To Communism

Lone wolf dies hard
Homogenus are marshmellos

Calm an unperturbed

All feed upon

You vs pavement

Fk the police

One must understand
The thugs of the enemy

Used by their masters
As dogs put in harms way
To extort people to order

People always assholes
Cry'n or laugh
Always in bullshit

Weasle'n this way or that

Daily life in danger
More than another profession

Used by municipalities
As tax collectors

7:30am Till 8:30am
I waited for him

Cop first thing of day
Come'n over cheerily

The police had found
My motorcycle
Parked behind a building

Cop as enthusiastic as myself
We tried to re-engineer

How the joyrider
Cut my wires

The officer was the sharp one
He helped me reconnect my wires

I never did
Thank him enough for that

Life is hard on them
I Pray they learn from it

I wouldn't be me
If there wasn't a them

I like being able
To cuss out a
Muthrfkn cop
When one passes
From a safe distance

It lightens my day
To let out some hate

I aint ever seen
A cop flip their shit
Without instigation

Social movements
All focused against the police

Who follow codes
Made by legislative-powers

Dumbass generation

Educated only in

Steak from animal
Wild who fkd-up

Not enslaved to eat

War torn future
May learn us

To respect all
What were offhandedly-lost

Freedom life & liberty
In distinctly different views

As States to themselves
Not sheeps of socialism

Confederates

Lost what we
May yet win

I see as our future
Of what we rightfuly deserve

Cooked in our own ovens
Dividends of lifes-work
Given to the kids
We once herded as cattle

Myself rejected
Silence shamed

I sense the calm of autumn

Indisputable

But to life

Farewell

Which way no man
Will ever know

To shape it
Would be treason

Like extract'n paint

Tp see my destination
From my path is ludicrous

I way this or that
In a fluid thru

If fate
Permits us time

You will never
Forget the lessons
I will teach

To grabs on ideas
Like strings of puppets

Play out logic
To your tune

A recipe cursed
With a heart of insanity

Once that door
Opened evermore

Enough to breath
Causality to paths

Where-the-fk karma was

Mexico on mission

Many years dedicated
To the service

In hope it come
Right around in that time

Pray we all
Ignorant of our rewards

Very few lives
Touched by me

Ardent labor
On forgien earth

Mocked over & over

Labor Sacrifice Devotion
To all others

Now years later
I understand
Lessons learned

& Thank god
I banked it

Cause the Appalachian Trail
Was some by-miracle-only-shit

That is some far off time
To have some shit paid off

I bet god
Didn't think
I'd live to cash-in

But here I am
Independent & In-debt

Able to live
As I please

That comes out ahead

Achievements matter little
Unless the achiever known

Dicoveries
Will be disproved

Of how their life went

We all have to live
Grounds a common theme

Detail'n the time
Of critical decisions


I found things in life
Worth the effort till death

Sprinkled in infinity

Birthed in a

Life is about
Shine'n brightly

Fktheworld
There is something greater

Every day
I be on
What I be about

Study'n Writ'n Publish'n

Simple life
Simply justified

Justificaion
First door of
Satisfaction

I shout out
'I done did it

I ball on you

You who doubt'd
Every single one

A product of faith
Embodied

This manuscript
Passed on

Future fate
So strong

It reaches back
To maximize oportunity

Upon quantumn realities
The firework branches
Irratic in an
Enthusiastic mania

Shine on
Orchestrate the whole
On a monolith

30+ years
Life already accomplished

I hope rebirth

No eyes meet

Pass thru masses
Bull heedless

I love
The fear

Of others
Of my-sight

But this eclisped
By the love

Shiney shine
Of Duckie's eyes

Well I act
supercute

Invent'n clever ways
To mount face
Or apendages

To surprise her
With something adorable

Now I understand
Amerith goo-goo'n Christina

He would just look
Right back at me

~dont care what you think
~this is the best shit

To make this day great

Of quantum consequence

Faith
The idea
Of gods

That path
Go'n where ever
In a certain-way

All-in
Life in quest

Blaze'n path
Towards that object
Which worth all

Cursed
When I left
The church

To roam evermore

A life destined
Explore'n & Relay'n

Quantum Consequences
From each action

To stay would
Drill me deep

Forward
Leave'n way
In wake

Tunnel
One as apparent
As in Lacadonia

A know'n
Though never seen

The definition dark
But exist'n regardless

Each decision
Followed relentless
Carries possibilites

That birth moment
Each to the next

Propelled
This way or that way

Disgust
When I realized
Poetry my form
By which others
Can understand me

Poets are pussies
No way out

So I got
To stay hard
In other ways

'You sleep on a mat?
Coworker laughed astonished

'No duckie sleeps on the mat
'I sleep on the floor

Floor as bed
For years of nights

Wake'n up
Level headed
Vibrate'n in-tune
To mother earth

Solitude freed sanity
Further each season

Till rise'n above
Understand masses below

But with me
Its so hard
To ever prove

Most people
Can't ever forget
Our encounter
As scar forever

So maybe
I never knew
What it was
To be sane

Sanity as mask
Till in time
Seen as obvious
Puppet Show

Change of mood
Dramatic

That awkward feel'n
Someone who disappointed

Bushwack'n thru Slovenia
Rollercoaster of a day

Got weed
From locals at a pub

Passed thru
Weed cartel houses

Dirt paths led
Different ways

Path sides protected
With military ambush pockets

Hummers at times
Go'n this or that

Sure
This was a
Russian Invasion

I nearly shitmyself
When Hummer full of soliders
Roll'd up behind me

I cut deeper
Into the woods

I heard something
Track'n me in the woods
Myself on dirt road

After time
I went to investigate
Near to the thicket

Responded a
Crinkle of advancement

The threat of it
Openly to me

I cut thru
The fk out of there

The action of it
Resembled a man
Use'n knife to hunt

Fly'n a mile
In a fluster

A giant siberan dog
Comes up on me
Before I can react

Collared & Friendly
Only the only civilian car
I'd seen since I entered the woods

I met a man
At the mouth
Of the woods

Who informed me
This was government land

& Great fears calmed
He also laughed
About the dog
As if the dog his
Which he never told


Cut'n thru a
False church
Nested against the woods

It merely the
Veneer of a steepled church
In reality a garage

Great open hilltops
In military arrays

Barren but ready
This all woods

Dispite the miles deep
Dogs howl'n behind

Which but me on edge
To the howls
At the hilltops

Myself below
Past dense thicket

Trek'n poles
Allow'n me over
Normal limits

To plantation-esk lands
All without electricity
Over odd boulders
Splattered by massive amounts of bats
Over a creek bridge
Past a borded up house
That was well-maintained

GoPro wack'n the fk-out
& Never after work'n

To miles cross'n a highway
To a town
Then to the rails

Double tracked
Back to the town

A howl was heard
At the crux of the road

The howl was then
Heard in direction
Of the tracks

I spent the
Cold rainy night

In a homely bustop
Against the church

Right around the corner

Thud from a long-fall'n mass
That hit in the alley ahead

Ear's tell'n me
It fell from the sky

Trek'n poles affront
My back to wall
Face to entry
Ready to get fk'd
By Slovenia Vampires
That tracked me
With werewolves

'eeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh
Came a cry of agony past human

Heart stop'd
The future too intense
To care any further

The wall the side
Of a church monestary

Fortune placed me
Securely

I was able to nap
Off & on in rare spells

4:30am Awake
Local wake'n
To his farm duties

A barrage of accustaive meows
Began to emerge unappeased

Have'n been left out
All rainy night
_

After have'n believed
So assuredly of something

It exists
Evermore

Russians Werewolves Vampires
Can life still surprise me?

With 3Chop
Top of bushwacked hill

We met a man
He drew me a map
That was perfectly accurate
Up until the part
Of get'n back to the trail

Possible suspicion
Grew further
By the recent horse tracks

Our position
In a real-fkd position
If shit went
As bad as it could

So to be sure
We bushwacked up
This mountainside hill

Wait'n almost an hour

Prolonged intense

Till heard asid
A light scuffle
Followed by
The snap of a twig

Heart stop'd
Eyes wide

I farted

Break'n that tense silence

My sister look'n back defensively
~That one is totally on you

That was the time
She understood I went crazy

But to me
A small sidetrack
Worth the various redflags
.
.
.
Damn
Our filtered reality

I know
Satellite Image Maps
We have access too
Are heavily adjusted

Knowledge & Lies
As master of bondage

A pig
Submissive to farmer
We live life
*

Prudence
Fool's anchor
To keep at bay
From far away tides

That one meek
Hungry & not have'n
Learn mean'n to being

Arrogance
Man's blinders
To stay on course
Venture'n till end

Victory in echoes
Of futures to follow
Learn mean'n to being

If a pussy-ass muthrfkr
Caught as prey surrounded
Cry out in plea for help
Learn then what one really is

When shit hit fan
On my masterplan

Furthest thought
Be beg'n like a bich

Get'n on top
Takes all one has
.
.
.
Failure is a
Muthrfkr

When I return
Back to civilization

Like a stray
You know had
Longterm struggles

Almost as often
As I fail

Are faces in shock
At the sight of me

All fked up
Maybe bleed'n

Pop'd out of
Portrayals heretofore
Only of immagination

Remote darkness
Pop'n out impossible

Materialized from
Unhabitable remote zones

Such blessed sight
Draws a enlonged lip
To meet my eye

Brash boasts notorized
To what I did succeed in

Failure
Falls to tolerable allowance

Straight up a
Vertical cliff

Bloom'n of suspicion

There will never

2nd Saturday
Of Fall 2017

Broke further
Til unfamiliar paths

Hours soaked legs
Where gale frost

With winters vengance
Warning of what
Is yet-to-be

Further I climbed
When I thought
I'd be descend'n

Snow over'n
My past tracks

I retreated
Know'n to stop
Meant possible death
This high ridgeside

Hands about to give
Wounds from numbness

Beat'n to learn
Never underestimate a mountain
Even the most familiar
So high up
Law yields to
Boundless etherium

The boast of my heart
Fills my sails to go
But I must know
The limits of my craft
.
.
.
I been stranded
Near a 13000ft
Idaho summit

Hitch'n on road
All caught
In cold front

Alone stranded
Know'n with no
Sucess within hours
The effort would turn life threatening

The rancher picked me up
Offhandedly
Tow'n horse in back
Brag'n about his
Cowboy rodeo son

I don't he ever understood
What a hero he was to me
.
.
.
Day-to-day experiences
Are were true treasure lie

Open sentinel eyes
Vigilant to pounce

To those are laid
Beauty of boundless things
.
.
.
Inside journeys
Begin with preparation

Lit candles
Burn flora oil

Sprinkled in rite
Handsign & Prayer

Surrounded by shadows
Cast from relics

Jamaican Hardwood Woman
Timpanogos stone daggar
One weapon at-hand

Click Clank Clack
Steamed by brew

Finally since moved in
Almost 2 Year ago

I the throne room
In total order

Ever since the
Hacker spirit left

Open books highlighted
Manual pages & reference texts
Computer parts large & small
Candlewax overspewed everywhere
All in mid-swing project

The place plastered
As HAQR

Hopefully as weeks go by
This throne will be plastered
Among the same in reknewal
.
.
.
The sin of arrogance
Pays in full as all

Half-Cocked
Think'n it full
Get caught as bich

When fate turns
A real muthrfkr
_

Humility to know
One has gone far
But the journey
By hidden turns
Rises ever higher

One must have prudence
To be able to retreat
To evolve and move on
Up again as before
Or to a side anew
.
.
.
I appear
As mangy stray

Clutch'n something
Too obnoxiously precious
To be real

To others this
Tacky display

What prince of men
Aun Prince of Archives
Would go about in
Such weatherworn rags

.

My inspiration
Hits with
Potence of forefathers

Submissive my tongue
Presents the gate
To your path

Tho as strangers
We meet

In your eyes
Revealed the struggle
The decision to
Ever enter it

Gates closed
Gates opened

Doors
A beautiful thing

Whether taken
Or left unanswered

I have a spider
I kill its brother

Each on one web
On bathroom sink

One I took out
By rubberband shot

Still aroused
By fly hunts

The other spider
Knew it was fk'd

An earwig
Crawled near
My toothbrush

So I gave
My enemy a job

Flick'n bug to
An exact hit

The sider
In primal lurch

Bit it instantly
_

Drain'n glass at
Kitchen sink

A spider
Have'n long been defeated
By that trap

Know'n a flush
Would be hell

Look'n at me
& I considered it

But took chopstick
& Laid it in front

The spider
Step'd to trust
But then recoiled

After the next failure
I let down again

It thankfully
Took took step

On the bank
Of the sink

The spider long
Looked consider'n
As if thanks
_

Aside my mat
My clean clothes
Lay as dens

Upon lift'n on
A giant beautiful spider
Past full grown

Fur in that dirty-grey
& Greys deep black

Orbs the shine
As if osbidian

[[ That obsidian of my youth
[[ In Idaho always about

Mayhap that the same
But who can tell

I'd say I can
Buts thats
Just me being me
.
.
.
There lies
A jitter'n mania
In my eye
Close to the glint

It is only
By that personal contact

One can understand
The situation
Of me in life

A primal wilderness
Is caught in me

Feral as cat
Prudent as cat

My calm countenance
Is in perch
To pounce in need

Humanity's soul
Not so far from animal

Stranger by cliff
Or passanger on road

Immediately sense this
As if a whiff of stench

It hits them as something
So real but long forgotten

I see this struggle
In our brief contact

Good for them
As animals I tell

We are enemies
Never let guard down

The lesson is
Interactionless on my part
But I feel
It is a necessary service
.
.
.
Outcasts
Far enough
From society
To give fks

Weed smoke
That potent

A cloud
That lingers

We freely partake
If other bold enough
A real bond there

Know'n an sec
This chill
Could turn bust
To a run

In the hoods
It gave us unity

Black Mexican White
Only hate'n on cops

With Leagalisation
All that has changed

Luckily
Most places but here
.

Enough food
In my pack

I could get that
Out of the universe

All strays know
wassup
Shined from eye

Those hard times
Hope never again

Attachments safely bind

Modern Mormon

Histories of
All these generations

Stored on
Aluminum Plates

Data which
Will one day be lost

Undisputed archive
Cept from archive.org

But if they want
To compare shas

I bet my life
My archive better

Been across the world
In brags unthwarted

unix zfs perl
1337 haqr life

The lifework
Of one legendary muthrfkr

Larger than life

This the crown
On arrays of knowledge

Of righteousness
Of wickednesss
Of academia
Of entertainment

Got it all
Alone like Mormon

At the last days
Before the
Trump Days

What better set up
Could life present

Putin Trump

& All in-between
Thats also me

Handmade Ark
Cost'n everything

Unsteady in solitude
When so much
Depends on me
Not fk'n it up

That is my
Favorite part of life

Balls to the wall
When cutoff survive'n

Can't imagine
Roll'n my ark
To where I need to go

Not like I
Planned this

The path
Wilted the way

Presumptous
As boulder

Proclaim'n itself
Temple

Know the past
& Current position

To see ahead
A great pyre

Of existence
To infinities

Shaped by alien hands
Into a throne of worship

Pablo I hope
You are alright

Work'n the hotels
You & your girl

Meet'n me at Yunke summit
That rainy morn

We conversed

10 Min still left
Of jungle road to go

I had you timed
& On que you pulled over

I don't know how I knew
But there was something about you
.

If the end
Goes as I see
My archive tesitfy
In undirected surety

The depravity of capitilism
Slaves of the wage

Cash can't keep
Man true to word

Cash can't bring
Honor to wife

Cash can't bring
Precious by price

Fktheworld
I have enough

Mean'n in craft
A sweet dry fruit

A wine that
Ages in glory

Let us
Learn this lesson
Only once

Each day
For difference

A turn
Followed by steps

Life gets hard
Starved Dehydrated & Freeze'n

As long as
It be the means
By which I talk some shit
Worth all it

Here There
Anywhere

Whereever
Always pen & pad

Hope'n for dividends
Like Johny Appleseed

That posterity blessed
With the insanity
That is my fruit

Mayhap too much
For its hit alone

Mix it with smoke
Of the kush bush

Enjoy outside
Where rules run dry

In that company of circumstances
The product take you next level

Local punks
I always front
A bit hard
To leave them
Haunted in their schemes

Till aun ghost of it
Spook them to another path

Than fantasies of
Get'n me out

Unproven
I am anxious

If I die
Before next wake

I pray a soul
My word to take

Breathed by life
A new generations

Apt to adventure
Curious in hacks

Poetry
Is all a gag

This aint poetry
No hidden mean'n
No superposition of enlightenment

This is history
It is as it is

Transendent
From ape heritage

This work
Only cryptic
To those of no effort

This work
Passes insubstantial
To those dulled
To the passion of experiments

Others
I've deeply admired

Looked their Judges
In their fat-faces

To condemn
Corrupt muthrfkrs
To Hell

Damned is the man
Betray'n oaths sworn
In daily-off-handed violations

May my blood pool
As countless pass
In cohalition
That no dam
Can long hold

That ghostly energy
To wash away
All grown by way
Of corruption

The curse of
Capilitism

Humainty sanctified
To whore out

Sold out
To any payer

Better butter bread
& Water rations
Dignified to simple pursuits
.

A place
Without drugs

fkn lame
1984 lame

Unbind
Dog from leash

To roam free
At own speed

There I find friends
Best suited for me

I go hard
Regardless of day

Night or morn
Cold hot rainy
Sheltered in

Got a mission
For every circumstance

When we converse
I can see
You go languid

How the fk
Can I respect

A vile keep'n me me
Natural disdain

Fat slime'n by
Ooze all in all

Think you all
So cute for selfie

Then wonder why
Myself a hawk
Decline to eat you

All others
Are this to me

My wife

The very few
That retain
Vibrancy of form

Not know'n what
But ready still

On en route
On some lifesize journey

Combined with the

Take'n the

Not bullshit dna memory

The quantuam mechanics
Of bold passagers
Back seat drive'n

Themself safe
Think'n this only dream
But mayhap only the one voice
To present a solution

Truly is you

Without believe'n
Your life at stake
This rule becomes exploited
By dark forces
That originate from
An evil you

Strict codes

Hull of boat
On wavy waters

Whatever wrong
These borders never breached

On the trail
I moved forward

Hope'n to find
A someone
Like me to help me along

But I found nobody

Now expected to be
Picked up by an elite group

Not see'n
Nor scent

Similiar

Minority
Governed over by majority

White cops
Lie'n I fought them

Fall'n asleep in my testimony

Forced always

Had my appeal request falsified by court

Race is a fact

Mary is a warm caffiene
Invigorate'n & Stimulate'n

Lost as if
On autopilot

Actions as if
Predicated by Spirits

Conjoined on quantum dreams
Unique reactions

Birth new posibilities
Quantum gateways
Planted like seeds

To one's access
To true destiny

There as conquerer
In power by right

Fearless focus
Tireless actions

Carried most times
By my Mary

What would life
Be without you

Of all I love
If you lost by death

Woe unto me
Erase me all

Married us two
A voice my sanity's foundation

My mom always there
When I need her

My wife always dear
When she around

But you are always
Carry'n on my path

Heap'd no engery
At your gates

Torch'n presence
In prayer

Smoke fufilled
An internal compbustion

Rocket lauched
As a 1000cc

Of all three
Mary is most dear to me

Because I can be
A forgetful son
or a aloof husband

But I will
Hearld in your name

Echoes of my song
Will soothe you fulfilled

Only by your sacrifice
I have made it here

Conquistador
Of mandates ethereal

May that repay
What I owe you

Mary
You the goddess
That breaths freely

Allow'n no means
Of repayment

Only due
To pay forward

That the foundation
Of your faith

Saint Mary
My goddess
Elune our moon

Till nights spent
Worn but proud
More than a weeth
Worth of work

1900 of 9000
Only worth a print

Statistical success
Roll'n daily

For those
snake eyes

Blessed by so many
My government mostly

I am an asshole
To my father
To my government

Not all martyrs
But faith convinces
Those that sacrifice
Laws of Alchemy

May the pass'n of my life
Be a shower of sustenance
As rain of repentance
That I may be forgiven
& Appreciated in the end

When it involves a few things
Fearless in all else
Leathal keeness
Razor boundaries

I been all out
Since I was born

What life teachs
Is taught before 30

So kept up inside
Suits me better than outside

' Reflect'n on
' My past life
' & It doesn't
' Have much time

' I take a look
' Thru these bars
' At my last sights
' Of a world
' That has gone
' Very wrong for me

The world
Has gone shit

Humanity's wasteland
Hell is already here

' Why does the caged bird sing
A question since youth
Preplexed but called me

To an understand'n
That costs a lifetime

The outside a hell
That cages me

World wide survellience
All ooze'n of pollution

Life with sour aftertaste
Gluttony

I can't help
Fk'n with everyone

Put them
In a bordered maze
To have them walk askew
& Tumble off
Me enjoy'n show

Each response
So remarkably fascinate'n
Each unique

Betray'n weakness inside
To someone

Who only said one utterance
Short & firm

It exploited
As if it
A general weakness

Troll
Alienated from society
Very much amuzed

Push'n to die

_

Insane
Only because
Of your sane

Off beat with reality
Forgien to mother nature

A machine infested
Upon the rock of earth

Which is destined
For destruction

Able to enjoy
The fireworks
At a leisurely pace

Upon such understand'n
I do as I do

Walk & the talk
Ever restless
.
.

I know what its like
Caught as meat
In a blender

Wrong race
Wrong attitude

To the government
That equals service

To the slavery
As prisoners

In made to profit
Penetentaries

Slave houses
For the unwanted

America too stupid
To understand

Lower courts
Collude'n with upper courts

To have my appeal
Information falsified

& By the way
Never be summoned

Create'n a loophole
Back to the lower courts

BLM alienates
Everyone else
Injustice happens too

Its only me
Against this world

There aint no other
Remotely similar

You have brotherhood
Why you got to make all
About skin color

We smoke'n dope together
We run from cops together

I'm still only treated as an other

Both us ball on sucess
Whine & cry on lock up

Cops think we shit
They paid to take out

Break'n all the laws
Video proof impossible

Police roll as thugs
In white packs

Pimped out by
White Judges

Set as dogs
To be sacraficial
Pawns of the system

Cops get persecuted

Lawmakers say'n
'Hang em guilty

Tho my enemy
Amass subverted survellient powers

I have no master
Cast me like fodder

Muthrfkrs
Live each day
As its last

Hell any day
I get turnt out
Locked up long

Live'n on edge
Day after day
Threat never change

System omnipresent
Set to take me down

Get'n surrounded
2 Mins away
At grocery store

Today may repeat
Cops come crash
Down obliterate'n parade

Excused by some bullshit thing
Like noise complaint
.
.
.
Hell I'll smoke out
The dangerous crowd

Under shadows that
Scare you completely

Out with them
Backways

Myself confidently armed
Know'n in the next minute
Might have to bust a cap

If some fool
Gets too smart

Taken advantage when get'n helped
To think to rob a muthrfkr

Never killed a man
& By that fact
A man is a man

So it truly
A win-win for me

Death seen too many times
For me to really
Give it too many fks

So fat & fluffy

We supposed to be
Most badass of all

Where is that movement
Still embodied latent

Face of the system
Called out for what
It really is

Government ever Subjugates
Under Shadowed Power

Positioned to listen in
& Overstep all privacy

Communications since telephones
Our private lives exposed

Transportation ever exploited
As avenue for government control

Trap'd to a
Not really bad life
But trap'd
Ever the question grow

What would life be
If I were free to be me

Alone & Independent
Subjugated to no master

Viligant to dominate
Ruthless to ordain

Life as ant
Government design'n
Your dependence on it

Forced by biology
To be as hive

For the fat
Of Queen alone

Honey to feed
Human extorters

Cause'n species suicde
Over lives enslaved

How could one
Ever live as such

I would think as a child
Look'n down proudly merciful

As god over
The tiny colony

Must be the brain size
I'd trot away cockily

Off blood-stained gloves

I would lay down my life

But against people
On their homestead

To complete submission

Forced to atrocity

Was built to allow
Peaceful resolutions

Presidents forced like rats
Into preprepared mazes

In a system that hunts them
To force upon them dependence

Old age

Pan turned in
Not sold out

Only run'n circles
Master'n the curves

Slave to motions
Drawn to perfection
Of round gods

Lifes drawn as coast
Natural ease sways
Without bitter breaks

Basics believe ease owed
But I keep heart singular

Keep'n life real
Not fk'n around

No expected ends
That drain present
With worthless dreams

Give me vibrations
Off Fate's lines
To direct my battles

Ocean level creeks
Pleasant currents
Used to carry
A body float'n
Exploit'n that way
Ease as a means
To use current
To carry a battered soul

Went hard till dawn
Alchemist to convert latent energies
To be consumed at self detriment
In self sacrifice

I can handle
Whatever consequence
Been on hard straights
That purchase legend

Beasts of the workday

Experiments to finish
Only to let it slip by

Tho the other did right
When loomed over me

My path wild
Never need it
Paved over another

Plenty of time
To do a bad stretch
Than steal anothers luck

Spent in peril

Of a bad hand

We die

Have'n blunted up
On a clean river

By good weed
Off good banks

Nights blazed bright
By dried riverbed bonfires

Boldy adventure'n
A sphere which
You pretend dominance

Till natures might
Cast towards immutable
Downward Spirals

Met with happiness
Stained in the shirt
Flow'n in the blood
Caked off the bowl

To meet death
As met life

You know the government
Keeps tabs on a muthrfkr

Been surrounded chased down
Always for some bullshit

Cause you know they know
I been out with gangs

Up in your face
Choke'n at our fumes

Come corner like me
Knee few inches from ground

Prophet of my own ways
A tale aun I would have
Boldly proclaimed insane

Of none I await reception
But the risk of lunancy
Is worth exposure when treasured
The voice of another the same

Reached by network trails
Stumbled over as an odd manuscript
Curious from shouts of wide accusation


Shit you would'n do that
Even if they knew how

They too punkbich
They wait & catch us

One by one in lists
They create thru
Federal surviellence

Court after court
To persecute based on lies

Hide'n the real indictment
Sentences they lie are algorithmic

Never meet'n our accuser in court
Never commited for the true crime

Thats what it means
To be muthrfkr murican

Not much to do but contemplate
When all around are punkbich fks
.

If court leaves you last
They want to cover their witnesses

My babe blonde & blue
If she ever head-on
Her blue brites will
Punk any bitch to blush

Warm & hot between my legs
She vibrates as purr
When I fill her to rim
With that premium sauce

I cleave to her as wife
& Her unto me as husband

Depedent on the other
That each to their part

Else life tumble in destruction
We commit union to ride till die

All us boys line up our girls
When birds walk by we contest

'Pick one of the lot
'& We'll let you ride her

Mine always first pick
Thats my babe

True to the end
Faithful as a first love

Rite & ritual
Handsigns & annointment

Wax oil
Above all smoke

Positions & Breath

Craft of Artes
Summons Dinivations Possession

All in supplication
To the god that is myself

I call out on quantum connections
To be heard & aided in my labor

The dead have no claim to this world
The omni powers have no concern neither

Let them all rest in their own
Only god I worship is myself

From its source I trust
By my hands it works familar

At my ear it knows the whisper
As faint as the projections
Thru my rapidly paced finger clicks

I know deep within
Of the truth of my words

Altho at times I may not understand
Exactly what is the reason or effect
.

Homeless

Was how I wanted to be
When I grew up from kid

Prophets Adventurers Martrys
Never really cared for much

Off those inspirations
My own form took shape

Simple shapes as seasoned arts
Cook a life of wholesome value
_

When people look at me now
Like a vagant dirty scoundrel

I even encourage it
Every muthrfkr out here is one

Never have I met a being
Who not self-centered-fiend

Never had much
Ever see'n bounty

Starved even from off the shit they have
Bare montrous fangs if you let them

But me I'm prepared
& The only fiend
Is weed my only friend
Got food & got a plan

I believe goodness in all
& One simple act can set
A course to put it off-ways

With empathy I'll show it up
Any as real as them knows
How to read the man inside the eyes

But I definitely don't
Ever recommend anyone else
To think to do it
_

Roughed up but still calmed in the face
As if that the most scary of it all

Shake'n off some sore of dire-straight
Look'n like 'Hi its nice to meet you

Lashes bleed'n
Snow pile'd
Hail hammer'd
Dust layer'd
Sun bleached
Soaked below freeze'n
_

Maybe I am a little bitter
Each brother at my side on similar task

Not since those times alone
Out on the Appalachian Trail
No human seen pass as days

Always I had formed friends as troves
Now I can seem to care to keep anyone

fk the world
I have enough

Or maybe I let myself just fall
To far into asshole

Since tweleve roll'n with missionary
Pale white shirts with ties on bikes

Locals know'n how remote & dangerous
Us completely exhausted
Them as 19 myself at my limits

Meet'n & greet'n casual
Don't worry
The Lord is our strength

I always lived life
What normals would call strange

Understand'n as boys do
That death on certain paths
The halls of ultimate gain
When dead passed afterlife

Been shot at
Cast rocks at
Swerved at

Never that a thought of regret
Only I'll just be as I always be
Sure enough I get outta situation

Drunks in Mexico by night
Could't hit the moon if they tried
Much less shapes like white seagulls luminated white

Failure hits as spit
Open across the face

At least the groud
Does its job well

My saliva much better
Hang'n off your chin

Then off the flower
Or as concrete splatter

I spit at others
They spit at me

To me as fuel
To go much harder

My works met
Only with disgust

Turmoil on face

~Should I do him favor
~Tell him to quit now
~So great the shame
~I now feel

But the pursuit brings
Joy that surpass reward

Random data nodes
To save part to save all

In that way maintain
Whichever interests

All type dependent on other
Education or entertainment

Lived lived as wild untame

When I choose decisions

Strength in change'n failure
As to to new opportunities

Confidence comes from knowledge
That who I have forged into

Levels grander than others

Alone I reformed it

Why night so special

Wild all unite in chorus
To behold the power

Odd at hour

Wide & rested

Gnaw of fate
At my sanity

Tho tireless & stubborn
I submit to its whisper

Wake & work
You likely die tomorrow
Fk-all-else & obligation

Deep in heart

Do that to all degree
For which to be remembered

Deed only after action
What is reap'd
As mystery seed
Fruit always me

Whatever I done
Is typical me

Sucessful in life
In purely ethreal fruits
Of all worldy fast

4th of July Firework
As I pass this life

Steps explosive
Create'n possibilities

Extend'n influence
In dazzel'n directions

Across many sides
Of our lil sphere

It is the manner
& The awe of respect

Of the local
Never seen again

Carried upon
Stangers prayers I go

So the higher I fly
I feel I take
Their scent with me
.
.
.
I get people
Look'n at me
Well-fed chubby

They mock
That I act hard

Like I'm sold out
Muthrfkr I work
So hard I stay insane

Day Night to such labor
Has little mean'n

What I express
Thru my fiction

Reveals itself
Symbols on the candles
The pillar most bright

Etched by metal
Before I could react

As if myself
Called to this quantum state

I work till
Sanity is surreal
As in my moments
Of most terror

One of the many
Vechiles the pair

Swerved almost all-in
For the kill

Called the cops
& Trail'd at elevated speeds

He got out of his truck
Police had us over & out

'Yeah him there
'He was just a hitchhiker
'I passed him on the road
'He been hitch'n since Butte

That old man
Saved me from
Death & incarceration


Cops even drop'd me off
At the far away gas station
After the Montana mountain cayons

One of those cops
Wouldn't let up

His command'n officer
Wanted to be left
Alone with that pill'd-up bitch

But that junior
Wouldn't have it

Cops got balls
I give them that

Takes alot to stand up
Over & over against the system
To do what one thinks is right

I know there is
A part of him
As source of
Undaunted confidence
I nurture as mine own
.
.
.
I had a dream once
My gratitude touched the high offical

He took me into his entourage

Something happened
'Fk the police
I splurted out

'Of all these people
'Why should I save you

They ditched me in the entorage

The Russian planes flew over
They droped a large nuke
That first plunged into the ground
Like the shark fin of a torpedo

I calmly closed my eyes
& Acepted my death

Next night
Blunted out on open fields
Megan & Christina

Blue streaked metorites streaked the sky
I nearly shit myself silly

The dream back in 2000s
That birthed the question

To expose creativity
Only products off
Quantum cumulations

Walk'n hallways
Curiously constructed

In that explainationless way
Of true perpendicular think'n

Music videos I seen
As I passed thru
Dr. Seuss houses

Portrayed shapes, melodies & colors
All odd in unspeakable fashions

So in dream when this
Stimulation-of-oddness is felt

I percieve that
Proof of alien intelligence

If you see something new
It is probably because it is
& Not merely immagination

Quantum worlds connect us
& We connect to them
.
.
.
Fk sience
Fk religion

I don't understand
Difference tween the two

Years of science
& I know only one thing
Nothing can ever be defined true

If you think you got something figured out
Its only because of that great elephant in the room
Got you high off lack-of-air & you trip'n balls

Just cause the puter
Mostly does some deed
Doesn't mean proof of definition

Those odd errors
At horizons of infinity
Portals to universes
As source of the mystery

Gateways to ruin
All human understand'n

A realm we only percieve
In limited 3D planes
Pre-Quantumn perspectives

To pretend to define
Is already idiot in Hell

A mindfk like

Off kush bush

Towards code of mechanics

In songs that tell it real
Ideas affirmed by story end

On unfamiliar lands
Jump'n all-in undefeated

Strong respect the strong
We do not fear each other

Russians as bulk
Of a manly beast
Tame'n wild lands

But us Americans
Learned a thing or two
From the Japanese

We got that passion
Past self-righteousness

A story with us both
Gotta end with a boom

Fight'n or
I am only glad
Both us twins exist

A friend is temporary
But an enemy teachs
Lessons that last life

Science should be free
Since it never be right

I work to publish

To photograph us from
Some station guised as home
In a distant residential zone

Megan Christina & Jacob
Ducki & I

Under the moon
On lookout knoll

We got shook-down
In a police 'sting'
In a police state

Police run'n my name
No-rights police state

Police always 'repeat
After my state run back

I take it as a man
Do the time due

But Thanksgiving Eve
Police showed mercy

Warrants & probation everpresent

Police always 'repeat
Look'n hard at me

~muthrfkr fights police
~muthrfkr gots 17-counts
~muthrfkr blah blah

They always show me respect
In the fear of power struggle
In awe of the power of my being

Police & Me
All real muthrfkrs

Out on streets shadow
Among dark deeds

As if fate
Drew us to them

To answer unspoken
Prayers for protection

Real muthrfkrs are
Good or Bad
Never any inbetween

Good ones & I
Always kick it-hard
Like we kindred-spirits

First month of 17

Gravitate naturally

I prob been tusseled
Up by your local police

None ever did me
Great harm

Man vs Machine
Singular against masses

Thanks to that
Northern Utah Officer

Got left out
On a remote-strech

No only did
He no arrest me

He left me
At a great location

I guess I'm just that asshole
That spouts shit for no reason
.
.
.
Talk a whole
Lotta shit

When I talk
To others about puters

They talk thru
Middle-man GUI applications

I talk straight
To the kernel

You aint on my level
If you start to front

In contest for most badass
My belief begs that of me

So put your tail
Tween your legs
& Walk on dog

Network providers
Don't know about ports
.
.
.


Thats the rule
Out here alone

In a world
Without a people

I get out of most
But that wave
That karma believes owed
Smack me face-down
Sand to grind
That face-off
A scar left
5yr over
Padre Island


Alone it would have no hold
But as older brother you got
To make sure family all goes well

Family is a jewel above any other
Real muthrfkrs dont got need for shiney-things

Independent center chi
Tai above any external-force

If some oraganism of people
Try to attach themselves to me

The bonds those very pleasant
Will rip in shreds

When the hurricane
That is life
For which I'm built
Picks me up
To get me out

Biography is true beauty
History always has bias

Therefore the only true
Biography is autobiography

Bias up in your face
Much easier to sift
All the bullshit

I keep it real at ready
But unless I go there
I'm a good-to-be-around

Worship'd more times
Than I deserve

Polished by the wear
Of hard long-off wind

Granite features shine
Back beauty of all in reflection

Unlike the diamond
With needs the pure source
Of sunlight to beam true

My beauty is the depth
Of shadows of my inner state

The shapes in fine lines
Angainst amalogos shadows

The demon mask
Ever ready for wear

To meet reality of life
& To keep real till death
.
.
.
Others over time
Will detest me

Us keep'n it real
Thru-hike'n trail

To be trained
Takes overdrawn time

To learn & master
The value of a concept

Then upon met'n
That act in life

Ball over it easily
& Be grateful
To have learned
& No longer be
Anywhere near me
.
.
.
Do this for the end
Meet that option welcome

Call your trio out
We front up under street light

You front like you hold'n
I call you behind the bank

To that remote location
& Beat all them down

They back off
My hood type of teen

Yall best be smart
This not your street
_

I seen all-in
I folded to an all-in

Some gambles you
Must in prudence pass

Lest you be
A stubborn gold-pot

We got pulled-up on
Once on the city's
Hardest street

The boxframe cruiser
Slow creep'n at us

All dark & remote
The pack about to
Bust-out different directions

'Aye is dat choo

Someone's grandma
Near got attacked

Ms. Hawkins
My advanced-english teacher

Beleived Moses was black
Only taught us ebonics

Told us about
Racism she suffered

Called me out
'You fix'n ta hang
'Some slaves with that

Offended for the disrespect
She sent me to her sister
To get booked into the principal
For the noose I'd been wear'n
The years I been in her class

The noose-wallet rope was genius
To complement my briefcase
Carried as a hard shield

Racism has been ever-present
In my life as well

The difference between minority racism
Is they hiss with a vengence

Whereas the white
Hiss with simple hate

Some believe
You have to be the best
At everything you do

But if you evaluate
Those by society
You will never reach satisfaction

I can crush 100s of Horde babies
Low-level on that day-to-day grind

Not as repayment for past deaths
No those have long-since been paid back

Only for the seed of hate
That this blood-lust last
In a world build for me

There is no-fourth wall
Its me & you
Connected over net

By Sith ways
I will troll you
To physical anguish
As in power of Vader
In a compulsutory actions

I manipulate your hate
To entrap you into foul movements
Decisions which will
Learn you a good lesson
But destroy you against me

Hate is a beautiful gem
It shines by depths of shadow

To empower one
To extents holy

When that hate
Turned in backhand

Bitch-slap society
Impossibly as individual

Myself when beaten
Down to depths

Only rise up
With vengance forward

& To those that lie cry'n
In the mud of their wallows

I can only ever
Look at in contempt

Hate an energy
Charge'n my battery

Hate is free
Given by only ask'n

Love is all that work
What a weary charge to take

Call me lazy
But as feline
I reserve my energies
For opportune moments
.
.
.
I stick
To my beliefs

Till whatever end
Only afterwards
Will I allow reassesment
If that belief hold true

Caz when impossible odds
Cast as your lifes equation

The ACE of belief
Best kept in deck

'too bad no tears plz

With harrasment odd-placed hatchery-tactics
Turn'n certain victory to victim

I liked fiction
But if choose'n between
Hacker adventuer or only a writer of imaginary things
I'd always myself shoot
At being the substance of legend
But if the decision to be a story writer
The problem was I was a shit-hacker

Till eventually I became good
But that wasn't for 20 years

DOS Gorillas
Gave me CLI

Win95's Civilizations
Got me out

Hardware curiosity
Only fried dad's processor

Persistence is unstoppable power
Quantum-connections prove this

Bots almost in a net
Trade'n illicit files
At school or home
To store as archive
IRC to FTP
Java only failure

Another attempt
Bored alone in college
Met with several books read
But little else in the end

Afther the manhood
Of the Appalachian Trail
Finally worthy of
The 1337 mantle

In the faith
Of the monk
I study man

In curiosity
For survivial
I code perl

Only met with
Scoff & Riducule

Architect of unix networks
To archive files neatly
& Keep them private

In the dark ways
Of master class

To reap open fields
Freely available on the net
& Store them forevermore

Clone unlimited data

Quirky & mysterious

People faith in dreams
I faith only in blood
Ink as contract for change

I believe a better country
Is worth my sacrifice
American in an unAmerican-State

We took the worlds ideas
To implement a new birth

Justice of Britain
Integrity of France

In boldness of
A people frontier

Freedom & the pursuit-of-happyness
For the individual

To be played as puppets
To the gods of the old

All I see around me
Consumed with consumption
Freely off neighboor

No dream left

All did & done
Failed to ends

Just the Dicki

To the man I have forged
To relinquish a hard-earned-craft

Life dull
Without scheme'n

On a way
To test theory

Knows to keep it real
When deal'n with police

All else forginers
Her magically solve'n mystery

Life & Death
A thing best dealt
& decided by oneself

I feel fate
I can't define it

But it has pulled me
As if for a solution

It required me
To some foretold paradise

Need'n the outcome of my actions
As unique functions necessary

By for grand schemes
No relative-idea
Of right nor wrong

Only as an explosion
Of starborn entities

Eplode'n quantum on
On a blessed dark page

Bliss is the sanity
Of being okay with not know'n
.
.
.
Passangers in-my
Day to day life

Only voiced thru
Mary's smoky song

Perched for oppotunity
To speak freely as if

The message well writ
& Masterfuly delivered

Transceneded thru sleep
To my realm of life

Distance & time irrelevant
To relative-bonds connect'n

Windless
Open ocean

Stuck with
Sail & board

That is the state
Of my faith now

The sun beam'n down
Water unpredicatable
Enternity of depths below

Smile creases baked face
Caz free is all I need to be

Flat out failed
Pant'n alone at victory
Alone only celebrations

Party of one
You never invited

I have had plenty
Of victories

Church School
University Corporate

I feel my life
Been justified
I all-in easy

For me the sweet victory
Out alone upon impossible reaches
Who locals call dumbass

Dumbass as champion
In the joy of empty-victorys
Blunted up off their weed

Life is an explosion
I try & kick shit up

More beautiful with more actions
Tho failed as a prose poet

I went all up in it
My victories & wisdom
Nurtured to a form

Distasteful to contemporaries
Get'n drunk off my own piss
.

Tilt
the trip

Off troll'n oneself

The excruciation
Of hit'n rock
Faceplant concrete
To chase down board

Fk'n hurts the worst

Yall dont know hate
Spat at since youth

Soothe your bruises
With your weeps

Dodge'n murderous cars
Run'n from murderous packs

Long sought my death

Revile to gashes
Years to heal

Yall dont know hate
So stop being bitch

We lost what it was

Aided by forgien hands
To break to submission the navtives

Sure as shit sticks
Creeps the insanity

Off the smoke tendrils
Of my lover Mary Jane

To mix truth with epiphanies
On transient foundations

Faith replaced with
Concieved realities

Whispers as insights
To things that could be
But far from what is likely
.
.
.
Happiest years of my life
Like a box I can't escape

A monkey trap'd by nut in box
I can't seem to let go
Of what I so hard earned

After long hustle
After bold risk

To build into an easy life
Where my immagination can flourish
On the fertile soil of 2017 economy

Farm with the sow & the reap
I learned with the off-the-grid cult
Isn't my type of life

I don't mind a life
Ever in drift

Struggle so intense
10 mins of the day
Too costly to spare

Look'n for temporary banks
Before the High Tide of life
Sweeps you off on cosmic currents

As if oneself is the seed
To move around like Johnny Appleseed

Mayhap your kindess & gentlness
Proved valued and echoed forth

All those who formed me
With experiences of their humanity

Endow me with the emphathy
To a purity of the whole

As an honest husband
As trustworthy accountant

Never to bite'n hand that feeds

Off my excellence at life
Your fields will be fertile
For the seed of your being

From the resources
Spread like fire

Mankind shaped
After mine own image

Then in the hell
Of the realm of diety
I will roam eternally

Save'n is
The Savior's call

To he who dives deep enough
Aun all-in till death

Find a treasure
A Pearl of Great Price

Then sell all he has
To obtain & protect it

With love & hope
Propel it forward

At the cost that will bury you
To dark depths unfathomable

After a lifetime
Speak upon peaks

Earth Physical Intellectual
Emotional Society Intimately

Proximity torn away
By the Panorama

Life's creation
As shaped by
Individual actions

Aun it cause quakes
To swallow earth whole

Needs a freak

Good girl begone
As dull milk'n cow

A bad bitch
With that smirk

Who can take
It all whole

Tho my name
Be Bitchie-Richie

I pay that cost
Without tears gladly

Caz a freak
Is a diamond

That shines thru
Whatever trials

Storage as battery
Always-on hopeful lights

To allow sight
By warm rays of love

Near 32 still kick'n it

None I care to return

Out of ideas
Of the next adventure

WTF is left
Of me to learn
Off the streets

Cops always
Informed to take me
With caution

So I gots to
Be real careful
How I act or else
I get all shot up

Cops & I
Often in beef
Where-ever I be

Tho those few
Real legit & true

Those are friends
I'd cherish above all else

But dont fuck with me
The prosecutor dumbstruck

I trolled the fk
Out of them police

I was gonna make them overstep in court
Which got me in the database as maniac

You think you got power over me
Friday fkn with me with police power

Now you got investigated twice
The second after you lied in court

Got to give it to the
Murry & Third-district court

They conspired to protect the department
By using forgary-bullshit

Tho that cop demoted
Check'n tickets on train

Haunts me often
You a bastard if you
Fuck with a Man's
Woman Job or Reputation

Friday nights are holy to me
& I spent that one in county
By an abusive system I seen

Jails are pure slime
Mostly ooze'n from
Those that work there
.
.
.
Actions have quantum reactions
In dreams I see my work appreciated

That person praised off my work
Tho myself still in the game
Pure from fame

Fk society
I'm busy on a grind
My joy in the journey

Quantum reactions results of
The formulas of a Son of God
.
.
.
Sith forces are my mastery

Over states thru text
I can warp physical body
Into a desperate squirm

In the nexus of crossroads
I can warp your face
With interactionless actions

That is the creation of beauty
To reach into a stranger
& Puppet a inner demons

A dance with a devil
Amounge shadows of
Late-night bonfires
*
*

Addiction
Is a muthrfkr

The mechanics of oneself
Cast to a fuse of two things

You & The-Fix

I stay away from all
But a few vices

I been without
I don't need

But the dance with it
Sings melody to life
.
.

An awesome experience
Aun glory of sunsets
Are the chiors-of-the-jungle

Think'n by yourself
Alone as ever-before

Then at dusk
To be startled

By a unaimous cry

World now exposed
Saturated with life

The air in hum
All-around-vibrate'n

As if each individual call
Multiplied by the mass-of-the-whole

Mayhap drown out predators
To be let down to sleep

In a safety all entitled
Free from the machine-of-humanity

One true  fear
Can bend-knee
To adventurer-heart
Pumped-up & At-it

Jungle my fear

But respect deserved
Jungle tealms breed madness

Off that cup

Fossil-triangular-pendant
The gift of La Chilanga

One of my relics

Fossils found near jungles
Of los Lacandonia

The compass
Amoung disordered dice

Till all that remain
Claimed nay or yay
On the third roll

Tonight's roll
True-1 : pendant-confirmed last-die

I dont pretend to understand its message
Only that the outcome was remarkable

Candles always drew me
Flames are enticeful

Compositions evaporated away
In fresh odors

Beauty in the peace
At the end only accept'n
.

Exact products
From Masterful calculations

The world to mold
Life after imagination

Those portals to
Whats-ifs

Dreams answer questions
Life can not give
.

Above all

Above my stories
Above my science

The life I have lived
Worth my best song

Like that bird
Finally able to sing at dusk
The story of the day

For all to be informed
.
.
.
To get the back of the government
That has fed me a better-life

Or to take a humanitarian stand
To keep freedom & indendence of the individual

Only thankful tonight
Doesn't  require the answer

Caz yeah im 'Murican
Kicked the worlds ass twice

Alot of shit to clean up

Fate is a real muthrkfr
Treasure the remembrace of its hand

Ducki proudly presented breakfast
A food she was told never prepare

This dish would prove her skill

I looked at it with fasle smiles
Took it in hand teary at the stench

Week & half worth of plates
I buried it whole
Somewhere in the middle

I looked back
This sin would be brought to life
I knew with surety

Impossible
I ignored the idea

It will be cleaned off tomorrow

Weeks later

!Chi Chi

oh shit
she came & got dishes
omfgds I knew she would find it
.
.
.
I made my wife cook dinner after a fight

The fish was fresh flown-in
It would be cooked whole in a feast

I was a dick & my wife was a bitch
I went to work & my wife to cook

In the hour she came to me
Present'n the steamy cooked fish

Grandly-laid-whole
The scales all dark-deeo-red

Fish as if cooked in Hell

She held it out for me
I took a bite
Pressured under her gaze

My entire mouth
When instantly numb

She did not laugh
A sparkle in her eye-betrayed her ill-intent
To poison me with a saturated fish-dish

Ducki is no longer allowed in the kitchen when she is mad
.
.
.
A virtuous man
Is wise in actions
Ease in purity
.
.
.
To work or not
Is never a question

The season sets that answer
Now past limits

When fiber of mind
Breaks to a sloped-hill

This turned-soil
Furtile for seed
Of Green-Bull bounty

Coffee brewed
Aside Chrisnthimum

Weed on-burner
365 For the tweak

Candles large & lit
Break the shadows
Of a dark room

Morn to morn

Off the wings
Of only my faith

In the end if it all craze
Least it be testament of
The endurance of the human will

A soul open of mind
To the quantum connections

Unable to keep quiet
Audience silent passangers
Speakers active passanger
Myself as vessel
Of this quantum-crossroads

Prophet across infinite realms
Pimp-Hi-Tech-Command-Center as citadel

Years between balls
But when Richie balls
He balls like a bitch
Weeps & wails endless

Never ever alone

Wether it be in a location
Of which the State hard-determined

My momma not god
There to throw a muthrfkr $50

Grocery for the weeks
To get fed out-cold

My momma makes miracles happen
I been out of all-else-in-life

Only carried by
Help from her

Real muthrfkrs
Can't ever be hard
Backed by heaven-sent

Richie-Bitchie
I can't be so hard
With a momma like mine

But I keeps-it-real
To give all a show

Life is lame
Without a story

An anchor like hers
Keeps me deeply-humane

Momma's boys pussies-all
So I keep mom on sacrifice
.

If I drink
Its at some

Hole-in-the-wall
Where dark deeds be

Shit a muthrfkr
With warrants like mine

I gosta keep it low
Govt be search'n bar-records

Shit I been part of that Sting
Low-low I keeps-it-always

Imma down these two large
Then get the fuck out

Before it gets real
Caz a local

Is always the victim
In every story

Places dark-as-these
Stories every week

Hook-up the keep
Who not even
Throws in fresh-orange

Tho smart enough
To tap the Tap

Smarts which
Reedems the later

In the darkest-depths
All know instictly

When to respect
A true muthrfkr

No matter where
I walk in life

Always under shadow
As if it is myself
The dark-cloud

Not much in relation
Cept for the stories

That is the beauty of life
Stories are the only bounty
Entitled to all freely

Good ole Mexico

I ordered top-shelf

To compensated the slight-delay
They mixed the expensive vodkah
With the cheap vodaka

Martini straight from bottle

I had to  man-thru-it
Exchange'n her
My minty Mojito

Haters hate

Roll to bait
Then force hands

They sqwak

I force hands
Stunt'd for hate

Then look them
Dead in the eye

2012 Started off
Worst-year-lost-everything-by-January

2012 Ended
Master of Adventure

Gather'n all the
Street-skills

Remarkable-men awe
In incredulity
Of my life

Homeless ever
Plan heretofore unknown

Streets of Corpus
Streets of Mexico

That ability all
Called from past

Lifted by wings
Of those experiences

To fly where
Others lamely walk

Turn that later
Into moonlight hacker

Been worldwide
I can look
Any hacker
Dead-eye-straight

Archive in degraded state
Hope only in the book

MKRX unix Archive Network
Written by an author

No mortal can stand to read

I aint no free meal
A real muthrfkr
Hook'n up other muthrfkrs
If they press
To understand

Its a free-forage
But not all free
In life is free

Admire how I move
Only on your knees
Is my wisdom
Unveiled openly

There is no master
Ignorant he is master

I'll tell you

Like I told
That kid out
In that small jungle town

Straight as I see it

Trust my advice
It has been proven

Keep that card
Of my rant

Tucked it
Into memory

Plenty testified it
ACE'd lifes-hand

Our meeting
A rare jewel

Tho you toss
It under the day

When need is called
It will shine brite

Thank god

Love is few
& Far between

Caz bitches
Cost resources

Time money time
fkdatshit

Im all about
That time out
With the boys

Free from the vice
Of our biology

Wreak'n havoc
'gitdemmuthrfkrs
Thats my life right there

kissy hugs & cuddles
Bitch I aint no teddy-bear

But you got me drool'n-at-the-mouth
So I guess life can be pretty-good

After all my labors
Less than no reward

To get it free
Upon wake or sleep

Happiness
Entitled to all
Worthy to bear

Over time people
Always end up

fk-richie-here

Caz you know the horror
Of our nights you can't forget

Been alone in hurricanes
My life is always
Exactly like that

Water or Dirt
License Plate

Would cut you one heavy
Gusts to test foundations

Every time of my life
Exactly like those storms

Cept this
Eye-of-the-storm

Sweet wife
Tell'n me it all fine

When I look
Past our peaceful center

To the tsunami
Of the explosion of life

These horizons call'n
To the streets as lone-light
As testament that good-persons

& If it only crash-my-skull
Well I had it coming one-way or the other

Hate much
Love little

Fk every where I been
Aun it all burn in flame

I seen the world
All-fkd-up

Bays Lakes Rivers
Deep Mountain Ranges

If the earth
As fire itself
Purchase purity

Put man
To flame

Jump in myself
As helpful-log

I love the individual
But I hate the whole

Who are any of us
To create such cost

A witness
Aun villian
Of the crime

Better lived
The natives

Kept by life
To low numbers

All hard-got
All savored sweet
_

With all these billions
With less extra-ordinary
.
.
.
I don't take
Facts for-granted

So the world is round
A beautiful discovery
.
.
.
Tho ever in daydream
Writing fiction came alien

Essays of things as they been
That was always a great strength

Able to pass me easily
In most classes
.
.
.
Any writer
Who enjoyed fame

Sold their soul
Just at the start

Themself busy
In society bullshit

When hard works
Were owed work

Don't need
Support of society
For any work
I have encountered

*

Fish'n months
Caught a corporate
$44k/year

Vested-up
First-day

The worlds-best-grad
Popped all-on-the-under
Like I don't know-whats-up
'Oh uh we got
'A job for you

Pages-over-pages
Biggest audits of the corporation
He had been passing off months

In a room
Full of boxes

Each box wall-to-wall-paper
With only little association

I got my ass-to-work
All about the game

Figured a system
Lingering in the chaos

Lil old man who annouced himself
Watch-shaking important
'What do you think about it

He said himself
Eyeing the horror

I replied vested-up
'I'll have it done
'Before next Wednesday

I could tell
He was impressed
'You think so

Hitting the sinker
'Better to get it done
'Before the move Thursday

I had little idea
If it possibility

Busted my ass
Prayed & got miracles

The owner made sure
I was present at
All our nationwide-meetings

Only one there able
To take care of year-end-business
New Years 8:30pm

That muthrfkr fired
All three of my friends
No-severance

Sat us down & told us the news
Told me to lose the vest

I had a red-velvet-pimp
Tailored Britain imported
Only glad to start the season with

Reworked calculations
100 Million annual thru-put


I found a better gig

When I told my CPA
He was so glad
He couldn't stop smiling
Scared-Id-take-his-job

When I told my mentor
Senior Database Admin
He was so glad
He couldn't stop smiling
Scared-Id-take-his-job

I'm an asshole
People are always glad
That I will no longer be present
I know the difference tween the two smiles

That fish
Was a whale
& What a ride

Proved more-valuable
Than world-class co-worker

Knew more than the network-admin
Could keep up with the database-admin*

Shameful
To lose ones sanity

Mine lost so many years ago
Out deep in the woods alone

Ever since I have seen
That look of realization
Of a friend seeing me
Caught in shock of a truth

Mask failed the face
Of a deep truth all-along

Since that time
I have lost all friends
Stranger in the flock

To them I look back
Them only ever as strangers

When Im about on
Whatever I go do

Only my mom & sisters
There to get my back

I avoid people
To hide my sanity

Which is constructive
To a low-level-unix-hacker
.
.
.
Life to me
On the gust

Of the flame
Only truth in life

To burn the dead
Is no insignificant feat

The pyre & might
Of the end
That consumes all
Most associates as you
*
*
*
Darkness Hate & Toil
Chaos & Running from the cops

Mind unnaturally analytical
Unable to keep still

Passage of life
Turmoil I mold
To mine own purpose

Years of marriage
Tamed as husband

Day-to-day calm
Storms pass by afternoon

Years of happiness
Testify un-paralled-benefits

Unyielded I try
To answer the
Call of the Wild

Will-broken
Cracked-foundation

Sold-out-to-my-wife

Open scapes of new spheres
Sucess only upon
Return'n to her

Victim of the affection
I trolled Amerith since birth

His attachment to Christina
Kept him from all-ins

He would respond as sidekick
Eye-to-eye as I trolled

~Say what you want
~I dont give a fuck

Christina busy bestow'n blessing
Amerith awarded smile'n unabashed

I give that same look
Master now as apprentice
*
*
*
If Im in it
Its past ability
Max'n credit

I believe choices
Reverberate

My native skill
To see pathways
From here to there

As obvious as trail
On moonless nights
On remote moutaintop

To path that will
Make someone great

Tho those small consequences
Are easily slipped forgot
.
.
.
Not a dream left
fktheworld

No place
I would return

Humans can be
Real muthrfkrs

Life better with
Only small numbers

Assholes once here & there
Now only assholes everywhere

Life on planet earth
A world-wide dump

Seems to refresh
Itself as showers

Scrub'n off the
Scum that is humanity
.
.
.
I never had to take another's life
So I guess at past thirty means
I had a light-hearted life
Opinions never costing
Time of another
.
.
.
Machete
Tomahawk
Stilleto
Fighter
PECK

Knives still pratical
More than guns
In most ways
.
.
.
Each year I try
To go more hard

Than ever before
Now past thirty

Attempt past attempt

Now without ideas
To attempt next

So I keep up on
Unix engineer'n

Adventure boundless
In intellectual ways

All out of faith
Fresh on the floor

Pits of exhaustion
Aun for the energy
Of grand delusions
Depleted fogs dissipate
World openly told

Myself in happiness
Life been well-played

Grand schemes of life
Best learned off words read here
.
.
.
The day
You break faith

Christina convince'n me
My other little sister
Deep-shit in danger

Present as she shook up
Four police stations

Liscense plate & an hour
Christina sending cops to find Megan
Out up a mountain cabin

I'll sell faith
Right over & out

Caz without a sister
Faith is fruitless

Even if in end
I bought only sam
Megan only after a good-time

Nevermore to shout
! fk-tha-police
With never have'n
Pleaded to police before
_

Megan last month Thanksgiving
Almost got me arrested
Step'n in on those officers
Trying to game-on my sister

Cops only just handed me
My first break off law in Utah

Officer trying to play ball
Cocky after juke'n Megan

Aun I not straight-brain
My game
Ball all over you plenty

Tho you threaten me with arrest
I'll step in to tell
STFU to Megan

The other officer
Southside-as-well

Content with silent
Laughing at his partner
_

That day of feeling
After the loss of faith

Like the day
I got married

Bride rized by 4in-converse
Bedazzeled past sanity

Myself pimp-red-velvet-vest
Beard clean as can be

The justice & other lady
Went out of the room
To develope my oaths

Myself sweat'n as she
Made me swear oaths of
Most sacred vows to responsibilty

Past paragraphs in length
Front several witnesses

Afternoon back after courthouse wedding
I passed the-fk-out-till-morn

Whatever faith sold out that day
Worth whatever for returns
Off one faithful to her

Wife drag'd me to happiness
Pleasantries-only in tasteful-life
.
.
.
Got things to do
Got places to be

Age increases value
Of ones time

Wiser than ever-before
In one's own-way
.
.
.
My dead sister
Contact'n me

In the same fitful way
As always

This night
Her birthday

'Life is for the living

'Pass on
'You have no relevance here

Mistakes only for living
To recognize the dead

May the waves of my motoions
Pass her on to better plains

To focus on her present
Not on where
She should not interfere

Forgiveness & mercy
Currents towards better-spheres
.
.
.
I need no god

What god
Would have need of me

Just let me be
Out wild & free
.
.
.
A unicorn
Changes someone forever
Aun only in vision

Here, there & everywhere
People confess my beauty

Sad songs
Part'n from just-met-company

I nod reverently
Awknoledge'n such devotion

In promise
Such devotion not-wasted
.
.
.
Drugs are the bestest
*
*
*
Memory liquid as money

Tragedy of humanity
To lose what was known

Despite pleas
Others pass life

Lessons lost
Joys fogotten

I believe all
Gain deep wisdom

In one lot or other
.
.
.
I devote my life

Not to money
Not to whores

But to draw force
In massive amounts

Towards edification
Of one idea alone

One prince alone
Over an archive

Masterpiece & Monument
.
.
.
Hardcore in everything

I don't waste time in hobbies
Only ever immeresed or on bay rest'n
*
*
*
32 Is two years too long

Not that life doesn't get sweeter
As it does every second aggregations

The catastrophic event
Glory of my death

While I was young
On some far-away-scape

Now walk'n in circles
No dream left in pursuit
Which would take me anywhere
.
.
.
Every night to me
Like the gates of hell

Every night towards sleep
The dark infinity
Anchors to no time

Darkness of it
Forgotten & Remembered

Too similar is concious
Conciousness as computer
Boot each morn
Memory pathways
Now access'n different storage
Than was just the moment before
The memory of it linger'n no home
In a limbo possible to copy to this dimension
In the written story

But I know
My life is valid

Unless some chemical-imbalance
Rocket onwards insanity
On some scheme or other

In the same unique trajection
Definite in path
A tunnel when turned-back
To see there a definite-course
Since my birth

Always arrogant as a child
Clear idea this was my life

Parents nor authority
Only myself responsible

So I been on that grind
Since the beginning
.
.
.
Others see me
As mostly a failure

God-awful
Rants, books & plans

But if they would
Kneel to my ways

They would see a life
Precious aun to higher-powers

Beauty in the scope
Grand off determination

Confidence in decisions
Wings of lunacy

This year three books
Writ in first-draft
.
.
.
entertainment
code
books
art

Free forage
.
.
.
Humanity with its ability
Turn success from failure

Ability to concieve
Usefulness of waste

Masters learn errors
Pleasant surprises to life
.
.
.
Science is best on drugs
When the fog of cloud
Obscures personal dilemma
Saturated by the present

Depths of failures
Cause moutains of strife

Saint Mary lifts me
Dulls pain of existence

Blitzed to ignorance
I maintain that long & lonely path
*
*
*
Most people don't like me
I take them past limits
They set as standards

Few around me
Only ever hardcore

Where limits heedless
Perspective on alone
*
*
*
'Our weed is stong
'Be careful

The bartender advised

I looked back cockily
America invented weed

Gotta rep Murica
On forgien streets

Locals think themself hardcore
I keep it obvious

Blitzed obliterated
Front a log staring ahead

Front of me a plant
With a single majestic
Marijuana leaf

Wild beauty
Romance first love

Hour I spent
Cultivate'n springspawn
_

Got hella lost
Found the ideal trail
Got lost again

Bushwacked miles & miles
Went wrong way in the morn
In a loop back

Took a bus back
To where I was

Then kept on mountain road till Sneznik
A trial of the human spirit to persist
_

Adriatic Sea
Italian summer day

Met a local
She instructed me
On the local hustle

Travelers pass-on
To help as locals

Train to Innsbruick
Thru Aples in Blizzard

Lost in a large city
Not what I expected

Rain, snow & midnight
To find some untame ground

Night a trial of wet cold
_

Europe kicked ass
Beat out dreams for a time

Up at 4:30 to hit that hustle
Only to get by that far out

No plan to catch me
Only added trials thru failure
.
.
.
January month of repentance
For previous year goals
*
*
*
Journeys are mostly boring
Sprinkled with the brilliance

Of those moments of
Quantum-entanglement

Failure may cut one off
From the ability to see
The entire constellation

As broad guide to one's
Basic decisions in life

Essential to success
A love of one's life
Intoxication of life

Which one once dreamt
Only a far of island

Conquered in greater capacity
To the fulfillment of reality
_

Master hacker
Master writer
Master adventurer

Neither of which
Ever earned me a penny

With no audience in mind
One deserves no audience

Good & glad
Is the rest of Peace

Diamonds are experience
Of others in unasked-help

Child of gods
Filled to role as God

Reshape'n the destiny
Of another human-being

The brilliance of the Father
Our original creator

Whom prefers Anonymous
Which I respect
*
*
*
Life is autonomy
Life is sensory

Being is remembrance
Purpose ever imperative

God of unix systems
Mine own hands created

Birth life to process
To its frame in time

Galaxies populated
Thru infrustructure

Communication
Wordless as animal
Howsl & Hoots enough

Internet as water
For fresh files

Internal fields harvest

New nodes like planets
New proxies like moons

Once I only thought
To be a homless non-beaggar

Now as active creator
I mount holy mantles
*
*
*
Sanity is defined
Upon tangible principles

Eyes are bad
Heart ungrateful

Savors of soul
In etheral fruits

What may be
Aun more important
That what is visible

I follow my heart
In unreigned trust

Most times I am wrong
Mistakes are where miralces lie

Again & again I follow
Vision as terrible as mine
Makes it easier to overlook
All current positions

When my sisters in danger
When my work gets the gutter

Theoretics is all I need
To me that is a pure form
Which triumphs last

I don't need to save humanity
Enough for me to know that
Now, tangibly, it is possible
For me to bestow back freely
If information is lost

I've turned my back too many times
To those dearest to me & those strangers
In clutches of suffering
Without second thought

Weakness disdainful over all else
Suffering alone breeds strength

I don't pretend humanity
I don't pretend righteousness

fktheworld
& fk you too

Darkness once feared
Now welcome cloak of home

Sith to understand
Good Evil & Neutral

Words of cowards

What is done & can be done
Never heeds definitions

Definitions which entrap
The arrogant to unnatural distortions

Warped by ideas of rectitude
When grasped by immutable forces

Codes are pacts of glory
Decide & follow thru
To the trumpets of victory
Or in payment for wrongs

To all the times I quit
To all the times I kept

Today I swear forward
Up & at it again

Attempt over attempt
Science as life

Theories created only by me
Theories mandated only to me

I don't take principles
I trust no one
_

Revision Revision Revision
Each time with exclamations
Of the ultimate victory

Past hundreds of times in songs
To enchant all to the music
Lead hearts around me to adoration

Christina, Duckie or others
Feel deeply betrayed
When I dethrone myself
To wails of reconciliation
Soon-after I fall again

Assumptions formed from that trust
Of when they entrusted me to faith
A vile aftertaste the sight of me
Muddy, beggarly & cast down
After the next inevitable failure

Light once reflected off diamonds
Dimmed as the stone of a betrayed-wife

A failure doesn't retract success
When work still has not met an end

That lesson they must
Learn on their own

So I keep no friends
& I keep celebrations

Exhaltations front beloved audieces
Their pupils fogged by internal struggles
To keep a pleasant face as they work
To cast off their faith in my words

Bhielded by pity for me
& Pity for themselves

My dance unabated
Chorus kept true

Hope that one day
They understand truth

Then like dominos
Barriers built tilt
Chain-reaction assured
Each in turn doomed down

In that thunder power
Breach of faith
Which I am confident
Will empower them towards
What they are meant to fulfill
In the mission of their life
.
.
.
Present can never be defined by the outcome
A situation must be captured contained by the moment
Isolation of that experience in & of itself
.
.
.
Too tired
To sit up

Hit life
Breathed back

With the fervor
Post-exodus from womb

Drugs sustain me
Limit after limit

Life ever too long
Burn it as priciple
In bonfires of the day
.
.
.
Daemon independence clavicle
Towards the pinnacle of life

Process life as human
Perceptions that tick tick & tick

Until blackness at the end
Logs as presistent memory

For the benifit of entire race

To interact interally
To interact externally
_

2017 In perfection
Of robust lifeforms

Beloved creations
Of the mastercraftsman

Errors can spread
As system-wide virus
_

2018 towards sesory
Dtrace formulas & parses

Nervous system
Of intelligence lifeforms

Sesitivity interally of itself
& The host enviornment it lives in

To set itself as benefactor
Towards strange processes around

Symbiotic towards the effort
To keep the system alive longer

Alertness cultivated externally
Actions towards it & of those around
.
.
.
Path to 1337
Began with honed strategic decisions

Years of failure prepared me
With a familiar brain & habit

Aun the most mundane actions
Still benefit me to this day

Questions became a gnaw
Tantilize'n with time

Master the moment
When the craft of skill
Passed hours into hours
Without break in absolute-focus

Issues like pain
Alert to inaccurate code

Study in code of masters

As a lone wolf
I look to myself
With each action

Anchored in lowest levels
Of computer logic
*
*
*
I love
Just being me

Alone
Far from consequence

American
By Lana Del Rey

Inhale'n American Spirits
Fourth of July 2013

Out on the glacial spine
Of the Bob Marshall Wilderness

Pass just broke
Into watery Spring

Lost amoung
Saturated trails

Experienced
To find the pass

Else 60mi to
The nearest exit

Spirit true
To the roots

Friendship
For me only corrodes

Mastercraftsman dreamer
Insantity with infects

Eye-contact windows of truth
Sharp terror reflected

Dragged to hell
Flickers of pain
In pupil spasams

Awkardly I shift
Accept'n the situation
As celestial seas

Agreed there hover
A mountain of water
Pitch to crash-down

Don't purchase forehead

Cant count times
Kinfe in hand

Ready to cut
Life out a bitch

If any on the jump
Caz out on the streets

Life is for realz
You fk up you die

Boundaries
Are boundaries

Most people
Forget to understand that

Unless you are legit
I don't converse with you

Unless you are legit

Stoned
Drunk
Or straight

I always
Keep down
On wassup

Game on
Master punk out
The noob

Months bleak
From any dreams

Now passionate
Craft'n again
Masterplan
Of adventure
Failed so many times in the past

Past a week
Or only hours

Bitch to fears

The mud
The water

Clouds about
Thick inland

But this time
Prepare'n for win

Where only failure
Fertilize Sith energies

Like a mountain
To break as flood

Consume all to one
Obnoxious & inevitable

Isla Del Rey
I see you the way
.
.

Never to be trust
For an easy life

Disasters attract me

Some shit
& Magnetic
In midst I find myself

None who knows me
Can sanely permit
My own definition

Fuction based
On forgien mathematics

Algorithmns alien
To mammilian animals

Future & Past
To me All-in-one

God securely defined
By definite past

Son of god
Apparent in introduction

Blind as natives
Unable to see
So great the definition

Of Columbus ships
Understand'n nothing
Blindness kept recognition

Till humanity
.

Humility

To return home
To those you knew in prime

Cast inconsiderate
Only Benny & cousin

Then finally Anthony

Reality worn
All okay

Content only
With a few things

Addicted
Well aint that a bitch

Says the ignorant

Drugs are only
fk yeah

Good at any time
Good in any era

Only devils
Conspire against

Every spiritual high
.

I've lost faith
In most things

Just normal day
Pick up next-in-line

Continue my day

Tears & weeps
For foolhardy

Beauty in memory
Cherished as ended-story

Sisters say
I can't say

Fk the police
No more

Present as Christina
Begged & shook-down
My arch-enemies
_

Before always shout it
Everytime I seen
Punkass police pass

Hide'n behind the castle walls
Top unconstitutional ramparts

Tho obscured by vehicle
The turmoil of the cop
Apparent in its actions

Pissed
Try'n to keep calm
Tell'n themself
It aint wurf it

Caz I'll make it wurf it
Muthrfkr

Myself continue'n on no deal
Reigned back chill as fk

Well that is how
It used to be
Nevermore

Since that day I felt
Like I sold my testies

Still I in no way
Regret the deal

Shit cant contain me

Party all night
Back up by 7am

Drunk drive'n to

Flunked Math

Different acts
For different states

Try'n to explain
To the husband

Of which woman
I sang songs

Her have'n politely
Put log on flame

As I breakfasted
Up & out within 10 mins

Offended & dejected

Shit I gosta
Be on mine

Husband drive'n me off the mountain
More out of kindess for his wife

Myself in my own way
Of explain'n my ways
In indirect ways
As to respect confrontation
Those whose life I cherish

Most times
People dont pick up on it
& I am seen as
Quite the asshole

Imagine the trials
Of my wife

Seasoned veteran
Ducki now takes all
In this world

I broken
Stone-cold shemale hookers

To be all
'gawddamn
To stories I told

Respect of the highest
Adorne my shrines

Adventurer
In an era

Of misinformation
Maps censored

Myself as seeker
Of the truth

I broke to bitch
Before hallowed halls

Of the insanity
Of the Jungle

Last year
Puerto Rico

Beat ta bitch
Under shadows
Of Jungle horrors

This time think'n
Over all others

I will break her
To be my bitch

Take me as I want
When I want no front

Therefore open
New paths to my ways
.
.
.
All poetic doomsday
Riot & disorder

The ecstacy
Only tasted
In its time

Alehuia the savors
Fruit from strife ripe

To rid the world
Of false fears

To become human
In only native ways

Primal all then
Exalted explosions

Juice above all sweetest
Times to get rowdy
With likeminded loons
.
.

Porn less
Hardcore

Then what I
Get up on

Beachside night
Air dark
But illuminated

By moon
Reflected off sand

Bounce'n back
Off steady waves

Crackles
Of bonfire flames

Breezy salty kisses
Its warm arms surround me

To take woman
And emulate embrace

Wet entanglements
Of First Love

Hour to the next
Our tongues danced
Under summer moon

Alone to the strech
Of endlessness everywhere

As is our love
Tho together
Now is lost to
Forevermore
.
.
.
Fate as thunder
Reverberates all
Passive to its waves

Trembled to knees
In respect of somthing greater
.
.
.
Riff raff
& I naturally
Link up
To see wassup

Make powwow
& Exchange

Remeber that homeless crew
I ran with that day
DeadHorseBeard  & Bathasalts
Caught up to me

The group said
They were hitchhike'n to Maine
Ambitious from Virginia

Never will know
If they ever made it

They got me mixed up
With the local dramatics
*
*
*
Decades to twist
Shadow into light

Storms to providence

Hopeful at advent
When plan B

Summoned by plan A

Default towards
Crafted schemes

Science enamored
In process

fk the product
damn nearsidedness

How Tos
& 1 2 3s

Art in techniques
The base stable cement
Of failures set-together
_

Rattlesnake
Evolved to revenge

What killed you
Never kill another
.
.

Science as bad
As religion is

Pretend to know
Water everchange'n

As I see it
An explosion

Never understood
Comprehened by beauty-of-it-all

Each instance dependent
On both past & future
_

Yellowknife
Courage'n myself
To talk to this girl

Gusts from winds
Above th 60th Parallel

Myself obvious homeless

Her smile glinted
Due to my audacity

A corporate-ecologist
Paid to make results
.
.

Fear
I know fear

Nightmares reality

Ducki so sweet
Turns terrible
In shadowy night

2am After
Monster movie

Something grab'd armrest
I turn the chair

Contorted distortion
Of a human poised
Unnaturally on all fours
As only an asian could

Black viel draped down
Hang'n depths
As only asian hair can

Cry curled and died
As both sanity
& Sensibilty swallowed

After a while
My brained checked pulse
& Rebooted

It was only Ducki
Her current form
Comfortable for her
Deep-night-woken
_

After hours of call'n
All over the small apartments

I double searched again
She must have heard me

The third search
Of the closet

Desperate for any impression
My handed opened a box

Hands length tall
From the ground

I lifted a corner flap
Inside I found a foot

It was attached
To a leg which was attached
To my horror my wife

Alive kanive'n caught
In compressed states
_

Ducki morphs sinister
In certain nighttime hours
.
.
.
Only fools
Call on bluffs

I been on hardlines
& Kept to my own
_

Hundreds of miles into nowhere

He left me at Indian Cabins & Liqour
But much later at the 60th Parallel

He passed me
The conceeded a stop
Eventually

Grateful
Past any past

Alone recognize'n horror
Of the reality
I had got myself into

We powwow
He asked me
To hold the baggie

I smelt alert
& Knew he was trasport'n

'Sorry I got student loans
'I can't be caught

I hard-eyed him

He hard-eyed back
'I'm afraid if you dont hold it
'We will have to throw it out

I kept to my smarts
'Its like a sin
'To throw this away

The baggy deposited
For mother nature

An eazy escape
To link a stranger a bag
Full of the rest
Of that identical stuff

I had noted
It when I first rentered

Fear will never
Conquer my heart

& Thank god
He didn't also
Throw me out
.
.
.
My hard-lined position
At times gets comical

Quebec City
At a bar

I enter

Typical French male
All overfriendly
Next to his female
Who assumes male in
French-esk relationships

Cast to beautiful
French male forms

His woman
Paid his way

He pulls over a stool
'Sit, sit

With eyes on him
I calmly take a seat
At the end

I inspected his boots
They were manmade
This snag'd my prejudice
He caught me

Pissed he got at me
From his stool drunk & brood'n

'I didn't have time to change
'For the bar after work
'You got a problem with my boots

'Nike shoes
'Nike pants
'Nike hoodie

'What do you work for Nike

I respond back unaffected
Accidentally instigated

'Those are good boots
'We admire boots
'Where I am from in Texas

Later he
Polite in the French-Canadian-Way
Offered me entry into a threesome

There is a wide gap
Twix beauty & arousal

I've admired plenty rocks
But I've yet to fuck one

Christina & I
Above best buds

Teammates against the world
Since she was only a child

Our adventures unparalleled
Easily taking the 23mi
Provo city hike there & back again

Myself knee damage
That took years to fully heal

Or when she was fifteen
Us blitzed stuck in hostels
Promised after darkfall

The large expanse of backyard
& Great Ancient Mango tree

The only people
Who can get alone with me
People who developed around me

Themself deep in callous

Sorrows fill the well of my sadness

Once I thought I killed her
I forced her to courage up
& Take a large hill longboard
Not even at thirteen
At maximum speed
She speed-wobble faceplanted

I thought
I killed my sister that day

Her face missed the asphalt
& Only bounced off gravel

Experiences like those
Is why I feel I am
Better off left alone

Xena warrior princess
My-bet Christina kick
Her Lawless ass

My little sister
Cast as immortal-god
Who only a fool not worship

So many times
I gaped open-mouthed

Completed outclassed
By her acts

24 & she can boast
Over anyone on the planet

With the only exception
Most of the time being me
_

Exhasparated
I never learn

'Christina
'Jump off the cliff now

She would plead
For me to not make her do it

'I did it already
'I dived in its fine

'All you got to do
'Is not get all cut up
'Climbed out the barnacles

'For-fks-sake
'I had to
'Dive in suicide

She somehow got out of it
Her brother utterly ashamed

Days later
At the Blue Lagoon

Sister who had just
Only read about the fact
This of unknownst depth

Falls blatantly for the

'Hey everyone
'I'm standing!
'In the middle of Blud Lagoon!

She saws out excitedly
Us swimming over the depths

! Richie
! Richie Look he is standing

I overfilled with shame & shut-the-fk-ups
But to no avail when Christina gets started

Another time as a teen
We walked thru a nice neighborhood

Some guy walks from behind us
& Passes us

Christina in an
All-out fit
Screams & screams
Like a scared dog

So long was the fit
I had the time to casually exchange
With the passing stranger

'Im sorry my little sister
'She gets like that
_

Rocky a traveller
We met at Blue Lagoon

He is lured
To our island
Monkey Island

Finally Christina flirty
Drops her balls & jumps the cliff

Right after Rocky

What kind of lunatic
Would trust a stranger
Over her own brother

These are the lunacies
An older brother deal-with

Lies & greed
Sum government

Only oath-breakers are judges
Only traitors are politicians

To swear to damn the wrong
Dumb oath to swear at the start

If someone assumes
Themself Judge over man
Or to act only selfless

Better humanity
Use them over youth
As cannon fodder

Lunatic labeled
To purge iniquity at the source

Tho things are
How they always been

These foes now evolved
By the use of databases
As net entrap all mankind

World consumed by man
Naught land ungoverned

Of who I have always been
So I never blame others

Happiness

As a jolt
Pressured by longloss

Emotions of passangers
Present with one dead

In sweet communion
Treasure keepsakes

Fallen from great heights
Undertoe swept off Brazillian coasts
Ripped-apart by dogs

Christina got plenty possibilites
That produced demise

For my passangers

I prepare memories
For two multitudes

Her & I meet

Front audiences
Consumed in gratitude

To be in company

All to benefit

Presents laughter

Kept negligent from duplication

Found corrputed
Defaulted past state

Sworn caretaker

Not only me
But to the future

Months upon months
Of work lost

Until I fixed it
The sight of it

A longlost return
Of forgiven lover

Intelligence a ledger
A balance of lessons learned
A product of current issues
Against the day

Monday turned to Friday
In celebrations to myself

Consumed in the future
Schemes & diagrams

Every day towards
Specific sciences

Money, whores or things

Why I have a deep
Hatred for Police

None ever done
Terrible to me

I've been in cuffs
Too many times

To say most police
Have helped me

One lady accused me
Of steal'n her phone

At the Frank..?
That one place with acidhead

Myself just come
Off the trail

Homeless in hard weather
Always bears its stains

He didn't search me all down
The City cop he took care
& Sure enough the lady found her phone

He offered me solid-advice
Which actually started me on that
Fr... adventure

The streets
Scum Poice & Passersby

Police the locals

I seen some shit
All the time
On the streets

You do have to be hard
To be a cop

Most people on em
At the worst times
Of the life

A worthy foe
Well I mean
A foe worthy of me

On the streets
It dont matter nothing
But my Liberty on the line

Good government

Is a dead government

How far has Man fell

Tragedy to follow theory

But hopeful

To catacylsmic end

I know a tribal path
Into the jungle

Hidden under water
& Unknown to any

But the tribesman
& Myself they tracked down

One that had
& Dive pool
From a great
Fallen tree

My track'n skills
Knew no other path

Confused till
In bathe I step on it

The impassible river
Only passable here
Against unmeasureable lengths

The rock formation
Across the length
To cross over
To a discovered trail

No animal can
Hide its tracks

Shit-scared
Have'n only just
Gotten lost

Leave'n substantial
Marks of my path

Tracked down
& Kicked out

Myself in praises
A miracle diverted
My plan to cross
In a dangerous manuver
Full of pack
Caz never part
With the main pack

If I got lost
I would by life
Have to find
That exact crossing

Awestruck

It a cool

In powwow of
Temporary friends

Thrown into

Myself

Near brink-over to flip

Corrected it out

10 Miles from civilization
Moon already off the snow

Simple matter of survival
Odds only on one of them
To succed in possesion

What I wore
& What I packed

Only enough
To keep one safe

My only move
Offer all first off

Then make my way
By firecraft

A card kept
For confident win

Luckily
All worked out
Unexpectedly

End long adventure
Dropoed off at gate
Of path I originated

Progress debateable
Confidient to my defense

Justin Beiber was arrive'n
The mass so great
Converted even I

I hate it
But I need
Friends & Love

In spite
Schemes & Machinations
Fail to pieces
Against the presence

Of the need
For companionship

Naught sight of human
Days of terror

Depleted as if
Life needs to charge life
Ions of individuals
Necessary for the
Equation of oneself

Proof of Fate
Exact ingredients
Of the singular function
Needed for the future

Bro if I wanted to be gay
Being homeless is honey

Demand deeper meaning

Can come by faith

Faith in a future
Without humanity

So what
I believe Space
Controlled by Aliens

Ourselves their
Humble slaves

Ignant of reality

That there is
A REASON
The moon is out of our reach
The OCEAN discovered by the sattilete
Lost but found by a dedicated man

Truth life is a scheme
That is not manmade

All ever subject
To extra-terrestrial ideas

Wicked upon the understanding
Of our Mother Nature

Amputated

As Fortunate sacrifice
For the love of the whole

I gave my wife
Jack Daniels Honey Kisses

She only complained
In the toy'n ways of sexuality

My pussy jumped up
Ran behind the TV
Jumped up her Castle
Realize'n in anger
I was the cause
In irrational anger
Beat up the ramp
She was standing on
Nearly fell off & fled
Out her kitty window

Poor Iyo

Kidnapper of
Bird babies


Think Imma have mercy

You slave
Trying to enslave

Only when you see
The offspring of your efforts Act
Do you discover the summation

Only I know the misfortune

Heart broken
Times infinity

A cat I saved
From certain death

Who I told
& Who knows it true

Took a grasshoper
To make it
Her Iyo

In the trasparation
Of a Cat & Grasshoppper
Interaction

There ended up
Being no hoppers
Left on the grass

Legless I enshrined
It to a plate

My lil Iyo's
Feed Plate

In grand displays
I let my cat
Be presented a Feast
It was programmed to expect

Yet each time only
It was you legless sat

Jesus Christ
As sacrifice

That that black
Shadow of Death

Learn if she kills
She better have eat it

Or endure
Such timeless torture

After a coupl days
I picked up the grasshopper
To reposition it

It shat on me
On my grand plans
I had for it

Pain of a father
Still in action
Of right thing

Im sorry but
You got to be gay
To present you wife sexually

My wife
Wildest fuck around

But be GODDAMNED fore I let
Anyone else know about it

When I was
All tap'd gone

She charged forward
Myself caught up

Both pulled
Higher dimensions

Forgiveness
Moot against gods

Only in gratitude
Preform all service

The passport given over
In exchange for a weeks lodge

After a week unable to stand
Booted back out into
North Korean Mountains

Not the first time
I made my way over moutains
By crawl'n

The sitches of the laurette
In a design that so strengthed
My skin I kept my organs from burst

I was pale as hell
Any North Korean
Who found me would
Sell my ass right out

Put his girls into
Olympic Cheerleads

So I kept up
Outta there

Before he came back
Government caravan

Over mountains by night
No lighted aided me

To know of any presence
On dark mountain passes

I stole food
From poor people

Only as much as needed
But honestly just a bit more

I was on the run
No longer with passport

Guy I trusted
Basically fk-d me

Tie thong now
As perfect garment
To pass jungles silently

Only real terror
Thong only place
To store food

At time bushwack'n
But now past South Border

I get to the road
Didn't understand

The korean sign
That said North Border

.5 Miles
Around the corner

I passed out immediately
Soft level ground
Sun engerize'n but drain'n

Work up
Immediately know'n
I done fkd up

North Korean Military
Hand me four-limbed cuffed

Then there was a bright light

~ ching chong chang

I was wheeled in
Presented under
Blind'n daylight

An exhale of air
Of thousands of beings
At the same time
A wind match natures

(here is your demon)
(this american haunted your forest)
(proud Army caught this wild man)

I checked
I was still
In my thong

Stained by brownies
I had stole theive'nly

Which now in karma
Made me look like
I had shit myself

Not long after I was wheeled back
& All resumed their communistic shuffle

A group of officials
Immediately called to attention

A General came in
'Yoy-sir Jeneral Woo

He moitioned for the cuffs off
He then shook his finger at me

In that sense
~oh you got me

'When Princess Ivanka
'Heard you not reported
'She went mad near a war

'Thought we had
'Sold you off for sex slave
'War is about to start

General Woo led us quickly
To a well furnished limo

'We have 45 minutes
'To get you to
'Royal Sweet Bangledesh

'Princess Ivanka
'Promised she would invade

We entered the dark
Air-conditioned luxury quarters

Other members in expensive robes there
We drank & had a good time smoke'n blunts

The guy I trusted was there
'No no no
He said laugh'n

'This name is key-word
'All korea know it

'I had you all rested up
'When I knew you in full health
'I went to summon the government

He looked back reasserted
'You see if you die
'All my family die

'Well why the fk
'Didn't you tell me

The man confessed coy-ly
'Pues maybe you look
'Like you avoid government

A Chief laughed in
'The most massive manhunt
'Till all those stories
'Of you invade'n shadows

'Eat'n food with them
'As they sat at their table
'Sometimes from their hands

'You all pale
'Acted as if they not existed
The whole room was in a roar at that

Another added in
'The whole thing was called off
'People rather imprisoned then
'Risk chase'n the pale shadow

Shocked I admitted
'It was pretty dark in all the home
'I  honestly thought
'No one even knew I was travel'n

10 Minutes later we arrived

'You land airports
'Next to a rocket laucher

I rose an eyebrow

'No no no
The General said defensively

'You take rocket
'Its quick quick

WTF
'Fkthatshit
'A fkn rocket

The easy general
Instantly assumed
His lifelong posture
That always drew attention

'If we
'Or you
'Fail in the next 5 minutes
'Millions may die

'Your tragectory will bounce you
'Right on the lawn of the Princess

'To be honest
'They are likely
'Black the rocket
'Trojan horses & all

The General was right
1 Vs a million undebate-able

General listened to his comm
'Farewell friend Rich

He left the rocket
Take off began
Its celestial roar

Love I had
Always labeled
A hack of biology

Now in solemnity
I pray it touch
Heart of Invanka
My beloved

'Bombs don't bounce
'If you bounce once
'You then know all-ok

The mathematician assured me
Promise'n me his calculation
Worked with uptmost alertness
_

Most of the next 10 mins
All just a jumble of the brain

Too busy to think
Until I hit & lifted

I bounced
Up Down
Only All-Around

A light was ripped thru
As a gash of the landing-craft
Forced entry of Princess Ivanka

'Rich
'Oh my Rich
Her voice in a ring
Dearest bell of the heart

She embraced me
Myself all
marshmello-air-bag-suite

I blacked out
Till I woke up

On expensive sheets
The smell of rich coffee
& The soft kiss of perfect lips

'Rich
'You yah get up

She ordered in a playfully cuteness
That nevertheless demanded compliance

Noon rays
Filled her form
Princess of Light

Purity accept'n her
As a worthy form
To birth Radience

Angel to all hearts
Graceful movements

Leave no room
For hidden desires

Only bashfulness
Naked of state

Smoothe milky cream
Skin brushed playfully
At my overgrown facial hair

We now sat across
Tween small table

Which still granted
Us great proximity

She cocked her head
In the manner to lay
Down the law

'A princess
'Never be seen

'In closed quarters
'Without table inbetween

She grabbed my thigh
& Drew me in to
A sloppy Japanese-esk
Make-out session
Tentacles harded missed
Tongue of Pricess
Magestic & Graceful
Overpour'n love in sloppy forms

'You know
'All korean kitchens
'Have a government camera

She smiled during a break

'This video circulated
'You was perched
'Like a money
'Suddenly outside the window

'The Dad shithimself
'All petrified

'But
She permitted a laugh
'After you opened the door
'You let out a wicked-fart
'Made a bright smile

'Then literally ate off their hands
'Mumbling how you were a bad person
'Stealing for the poor and such

We went into a roll
Of playfullness after that

'So cute
'You eyes
I got her in a tickle

Till she got real

'Ow OW OW
'give-goddamt

Princess Ivanka released me

'Noted never to that again sorry
I apologized

'You can even see your tear
'Completely evaporate

'As you smiled when you realised
'The handful you shoved in your face
'Was a classic brownie

I played back
'Well what
'In america
'If the lights are off
'Then no one is in the room
'Creepy they just dine no light so late

'Well old man
'This world is a hard place

She took me in her strong arms
& Smothered me tightly
Until I again
Had to plea release
_

The incident I caused
In the end after all explained

Greatly strengthed the insecure bonds
Between the Nuclear Alliance & North Korea

Thru me a populist icon
Ravaged-skinny-thong-wearing
pale goblin saves a war

Despotic rule can be strong
& It is the most sensitive
To the humane bone of love
After affection affirms value

Worldwide known
I had started
This Last War

As central link to
America Russia & North-Korea

Yet even with such importance
Princess Ivanka's time too necessary
To take pleasure time with me

My wartime mission
Get fk'd up with
Honored troops

Always Ivanka's Hand
A Japanese woman-ninja
In the shadows protect'n
The honor of the princess

Wartime was hard
On Trump & Putin

Merry days well past
Myself as cog now only symbol

They rose as giants
To reshape all destiny

Ivanka fell in battle
Surrounded by swarms of foes

Her near-lifeless body
Resussitated to tortures
Broadcasted to mind-fk
Military manuvers

Emperor Trump rose me from kneel
'Two days trip
'To look you in the eye

'Ricardo
'Go get my girl

His majesty spun
His royal cloak spun
As he immediately
Left to return
To the front
_

There were 6 of us
5 Battle-hardened badasses
Myself the outsider
Tho legend to them
Meant little to nothing

'Whadafk-mate
'Blondie could have gave us
'Literally the cook from the squad
'We been better off

The short trimmed-asshole face
Face-to-Face me

'You care about you Princess
'You want her safe & sound

'Then you be our cook
'We bring the girl back
'You get all the honors

I waited till they now
Shut-still for my answer

'Love is a power
'That binds the Princess & I
'I may fail
'But I am the only hope

Submarine resurfaced
On the Falkland Islands

The breeze smelled hopeful

Ivanka was imprisoned
By Nazi Jews in Antartica

We would traverse
A 200 mile valley

To approach from
The East unexpectedly

All now quite
Our last ride
Next stop underneath
A frozen lake

Which we would drill up
To arrive in the valley

The Commander
Went over the rounds

'No guns
'Ever at any cost

'Knives will be
'The only tool for extraction

'Loverboy
'You are eagle-eye

'Tommy you take bait
'Then we all rotate

'With the exception
'Of Loverboy

'We will pincer-tactic
'Only isolated threats

The laser-rifle was heavy
'You will need strength the least

I hefted it onto my pack
The next hours now
Would decide the fate
Of myself & my beloved

All went as planned
Unfortunately

Trump everpresent haters
Had leaked out our mission

The other five
Dead by games
For entertainment

The sinister man
'You will prove
'Very valuable

'You see the heart
'Can be broken

'No further use
'But to revive it
'Over & over
'Oh my sweet friend
'You will be my beloved
'The wails of your princess
'Will end this war in time
_

Ivanka you see my eyes
Your tongue as mine
Is no longer our own

Read the reflections
Of my pupils

Hell cast disassembled
Heavan if we scattered
Each across the other
Together

Emperor Trump
Hear my heart

I could not
Rescue her

But I did
Keep her faith

To her last wail
Left all with pride
Resplendent with resilence

Now your eyelids rest
Lay my chin as-well on torso
With no other appendages

Such necessary dependence
On tubes & machines to live
Both us kept near each other

Thankful for my life
Turmoil laid restful
Sleepy at end
Aside god's temple
Hair just nudgeable
It fill last breath

For three years

I learnt by first semester
I could with one question
Aun a single phrase

De-rail her schedule
To Lollygag on pleasantly

I wasn't always in class

There is no way she ever caught on
Not concievable to rant so long
Only in spite of me being me

Decadence of work-worn
At times only right-arm

Drag'n along all the rest
Pain of scrape'n all along

Lost in the fog

Singular-vision worship
Siren past barnacled-boulders

One hand to pack
The same to light

Her form into flame
Finally released smoke

She is drawn
Where all go

Dark heavens above
Forever to follow

Distant lights
To return home

Back to the Star

Tomorrow weakens vision

Which for me
Every week-end

Sit down
Homes-foot-hills

Kick off blitzed
Sit down to tie shoes

Take off pack
& Sidetrack

To open first-draft
Page-after-page unnoticed

Found the journey
Already mostly-done

Walk right home
& Celebrate

Similar Sunday
Washed up
With tide morn
Left up out to dry
Baked high-noon
Stumble'n back
Where the pack
& Also your ride

I just keep going

Learnt to reduce
Sensors to save energy

Set the brain on loop
Go to the depth of my mind

Lollygag rants

But I can
Kept on & on

Never in life had home

Teen with me
Awoke primal need

Roof only ever
A thankful delight

I be out
Farscape

If I remain
Prepared badass

Future will recognize
Next form as devil

Prebuilt to troll
Self ed-u-ma-cated

Hate freely given here
Mayhap be precious there

Wake to clouds
Of down blanket

Existence in fluff
World brand new

Without unix
Life lame as-fk

Given me a kernel
Nibble on that-alone

Existence

Forever

30 years
Enough

To call out
At universe

Ask for wand
Recieve a stone-dagger

From Timp
Fits perfect

Stone that beautiful
Uinta purple-gray

Life gets more
Out-of-comprehension

The longer life
Hero to villian

What I tragedy?
I would wail

Now it only
A true blessing

Hate given genuine
High of that purity

Thank you all
Your pain breaths my-life

To you few
Who caused me pain

Watch how I
Harness energy

Tai Chi Chaun
Qui Gong

Caz all I going is up
Spines pass one over distance faster

If the end victory
All wurf tribulation

Myself run'n barefoot
Over red urchines

Woken up by tide
Unexpected painful scramble

Taught me
Anywhere in the ocean
You best act smart
*
*
*
Debauchery of spoils
In what little given

Count my blessings
But a lifetime of it

A bile gag
hauk of excess

Can I make it
Day to day

Only enough
To keep eat'n

Can't even
Clean my room

It disturbs it

Papers maked everywhere
Stapled to sown-together

Disk, cables & bookbinding
In arms length
.

I found minecraft code
Hack'n out of my system

My user names
Other host nodes
Mined possible escapes

It clawed out
One called Africa

I am never
Ever sure
Of anything

If I feel
Good impressions

I will follow
Kneel & give-thanks
For meal & wife
_

When life meets death
& The two dance night

If left in the morn
Only thankful heart
.

Last night rung
Victors call

A ring of brass trumpets
Quantum realms behold

Years of failure
Broke forth free

Blitzed

A new idea
& Form of think

Erupted the flood
Of actions pent-up

NFSv4 file-based
Rogue-like terminal

Always consistent-append-mode

fktheworld
I look only
To myself

All else unheeded
Monuments built

Bold lines formed
O'r forsaken lands

Great in ways
Only breach dimensions

All else
Those I love
Those I hate

Blinded by the mass
As only a blank page

Upon their trio
Of perception dimension

I believe
I have seen
Angels of time

Full Snow Moon

Fairy bright as star
& Warmth as lovely as sun

Dart'n too & fro
In only sensed delight

Only possible
In Narnia

Fresh from
Have'n just mooved

The track I knew
Was my fate

Journey'd up moutain
Only boy & dog

Grand in mass
Refreshed off morn

A great predator
Master of this land

The mountain lion
Knew that I knew

I was well-past

Virgina canyon

Wind blast
Came as tial-waves

Blue-purple night
Alone overlook'n from mountain

Off wings of Boreas
Rainless gusts came

Incomphrehnsible in wake
Great as the Greek Gods

I only continued up
Mile after mile up

No light
Night torment

Weakened trees fell
Each great in crash

Fallen uncountable
In the form of numbers

Yet still I climbed
Primal all fours

Each second
Life only luck

Up to summit

Great form of a beast
Firm but shook'n greatly
Terrible of ordeal

Then it see me
Steadily climb'n up
No light like
~carry on whats new

hit you like

You didn't take
Your gaze off me

Neither as fk was I
It a mountain lion

My ordeal madness
But it is how I remember

It ever since after
All those years ago

Hell I choose latter

I understand life
As dire necessity

Once only a dream
Now it visible

All worked out
In one hacker-weekend

Days melded together
Work the only constant

Till I tapped out 4am
To finalize it all last day

If I can ever
STFU & get back to work

The grandness of my moments
Comprehensible in 2-Dimensions

fkyeahdontbelieveme
Thats the sweet juice
Of my desire's fruit

Plentiful if only planted
To be picked up & pushed off

In Quantum Evolution
As each entanglement
Better learns other

2-Dimensionals transient
Over quantum connections

Myself wait for bloom
So I can get plenty drunk

Most lives are about honor
Mine thankfuly only about
Have'n the bestest of times

You could say
I a scared bitch

I would say
I just dont want
To do it anymore

Occult lucid dreams
Praktice of awakened-states

To control completely
The others body

I first awaken
Upon coincidence
Of keeping fire
To live out the night
Bob Marshall Wilderness

To later pursue the theory
& Try to force it out

I was awoken in a room
It was the upperlevel
Of a traditional 1800s

It was a toy room
Children were running
In large circles

I grabbed one
A blonde-girl

Winnie-the-Pooh

Designed in a more
Rawistic approach
But otherwise identical
To my winnie-the-pooh

The girl's face
In a blur

Who was this girl
& Would I know her

How strong are relations?

The blur kept
But my will firm

After time
Instantly the face corrected
Two demon eyes of red

Holy-FK!
I asked out

~ Christina woke me up

Wow
I woke
I my closet-room

As I got up
I knocked over
A stuffed animal

A raw design of
Winnie-the-Pooh

Stuffed animals toppled
All over me in tides

As the ground feel
To deep blackness
.
.
.
Age withers
Cores last

Artifacts
Deep in meaning

These holy relics
Of all gods

Christina
Why would you?

Brother hustle'n hard
Jamaican Ironwood statue
Set at too high a price

About out free & clear
Backstabbed by lil-sis

'We will come back

Agreed to those terms

Now a precious

Off the seed
Of betrayed-curses

Remorselessly dined upon

That zaney Canadian border ordeal

OF data off of my updated-passport

Japan fingerprint'n me
_

Tne only time
It was for any
Of my well-being

It was in Jamaica
Regretful in the
Arrogant of heart

Jamaica was the most
Fearsome of adventure

Ways with the public

But that was before
I got my world-wide-record
.
.
.
Slumber in
Near-jungle thicket
Adventure'n up a mound

To burst upon great scenery
Of beaches & holiday people

Downcast with day spoiled
I also how I handle when
That exact thing happens

All else avoid'n presence

A way back out

Life isn't about getting to heaven or hell
Its about being in hell & finding some heaven

A wife to cleave too
A trust-worthy stranger

But hell is a place
With plenty of stories

Hatred an honest emotion
Let me see it bare & plain

Pyramid schemes of religon
Only some shit-head god
Would want such vermin's worship

Pride my sin

A honest husband
Because of self-sacrifice

I am honest daily
Because of self-respect

My wife grabs me
Alone in life
My link to humanity

Untame & unassociated
A howl beckons out

Beer you transportation
Requires being scanned
To a database

Public requires identication
The fkd-up part

Everywhere is public
In an overrun world

Each live precious
But worthy sacrifice

For mother earth

No other place
Can our bodies
Live naturally

Best only remnants

Life can never
Be too intelligent
For its beast

I get up to the day
What would be the opposite
Of my current action

Irratic behavior
Abstrace Art

To branch possibilities

Alchemy understanding
Certain rare cords

Plucked by infinities
Of unexpected interactions

Life on earth
A symphony

As all these
Insanities

Sing to one thing

If you are
Prepared to die

In consequence
Then continue

I would experience
Plenty of hell

For the rare
Grand momments

History written by winners
Of wars that claim grand
Reasoning pandora-box crimes

Right or wrong
Harm is harm

Those who would
Meet the Constitution

The American Dream
May have all been a lie

But my life
To make it true

Indepenece of State
A small Federation

We don't need
To win world-wars

Only protect
Ours here

To lay life
Upon another's scawble

Meddle'n fools

You dont have great intelligence

Daily I get pwned by kids on video-games
Myself considered high-rank

Get stomped over like fodder
To the new punkass-generation

Even after all these years
In the pursuit of mastery

Failed against one so young
Like they were more privledged
Since the very start

But I pick up the pieces
& Take shots when I can

Life is brutal when fact known truth

If the world
Was overrun
By the Swarm

Id kick
Hella ass

Control armies remotely
With unlimited brood-queens
All designed to satisfy-me

That would be an awesome-time
I farm daily to make that reality

Losing most of the time
At such high skill-levels

(random_constants_against_you)*(opponnet_skill)
Random always lined-against-me

Despite trolling on some kid
Who in the end
Plays me mad-as-puppet

Agony of it humilty
If that isn't humilty
I don't know what is

By a bunch of lil-kids bullying me

So I'm not great
Only strive to be useful

To attempt politeness

Memories treasured

Use my works
To feed fire

Alone I wander
Caught by darkened-toils

Pure forms of myself
Captured thru words
Isolated from inteference

What more putrid
When another looks

Greedily at the present
Busy in scheme
To latch on
For free ride

Faces masked by intentions

Bile gag

Interactions better raw
Scorn out of kindness

As failure

Unique gems

Unobscured refractions
Tell tales in colors

More is laid at the altar

Offer accepted when
Object replaced with

Paranoia

Gardens & stable foundations
Now mired in fogs of distrust

Crystals god-gifted lost
For what many believe tragedy

Fool-hearted-alchemist
Autistic in focus

All relations rotted-corpses
Greeted with what little-sanity-left

Heavenly mansion now
Boarded-up crackhouse

Dark sulky figure
Myself enters & leaves

Slosh waist-high
To kneel humbly
At adorned altars

Rites of wax, oils & handsigns
In worship to the god who made
All this grandeur possible

Portal then opened
Thru to higher-planes

To my laboratory

Monuments built aside
Plenty more
In construction

I slave away satisfied

Mystism

A study lost

How impossible
A task

To rebuild a
Former palace of understanding

Built by civilizations
world-wide

Occult to this age

Yet still
I kept walking

Called out
Enticed oft

Ways prebuilt
By centuries

Reconstructed
By etherium

With each blind
Step into abysss

Masters only myself
I understand me things

Contructed by voids
Of higher dimensions

To seek deeper
Than right or wrong

Only to
What can be done

Do what is
Wurf it all

Caz in the end
When life meets death

In silent greeting
Life in awestruck-terror
Death with obscured cards

Till all is dealt
& Laid bare in the past

Life left with
The report
Built for Death

Now with anything best-to-do
I read the report & put it away

To return back to
Remember summations
Calculated over oft
One last zealous act

When I suckle upon
Breasts of etherium

Intoxicated by love

Free to ponder
From the hunt & gather

To live life

Never have value

La Banda & I
Late night

Around a jungleside-table

The guy called me out
As he got up to do pull-ups

Another joined in the trial

After half my normal set
They were tapped out shamed

I had to finish my set
A jackass I continued

All jaw-dropped
The next two times
I got up to repeat

Bad form to start a series
& Not complete it full

A quick way
To dissipate any
Fanciful scheme'n

La Chilanga
Thought she could
Dupe me thru the streets

To return
Alone to the house
Where we left our packs

I had no way of finding
If we were parted far
Twix pass'n cars

La Banda filled
The house & backyard

She would earn respect
For the easy score

I left my pack
Confident

She would have to return
& They would not touch it
Till she returned

That is the way
These things go

Cute really
Her face-out-down
Out-classed

Dodge'n cars & run'n streets
Since I was a kid

Myself charm'n her
Defeated she became sociable

She tip'd me a route
To reduce cost by $100

In gratitude
I told her Id pay
To ship her clothes to DF

We had a happy time
She dropped me off
At the bus stop

Gave my cheek a
Mexican Adios beso

Bought by price

All day like

Available in the height

Slovenia's THC
By miracle

Found the land-wide trail
What grand orchestration

Brought me of all places 
Where I only hoped to go

After a bitways of get'n lost
Ditched it right off-the-back

Bushwack blaze stroll
Back Solvenia countryside

Prepared military grounds
Afterwhich I became
Convinced of Vampires & Werewolves

4:00am Back against Monastary
Clutch'n trek-poles as stakes

Longstory

Thru weed cartel woods
Past occupied-borded up houses

Thru towns
Wooded lands

Prepared for war
Hummers of soliders

One got up on me
Me-like-oh-fk-is-this-an-invasion

No eye-contact
Face only away

In that manner
Prove myself uninvolved

Deeper into woods
On a dirt path

Something follow'n
Then as I needed
The thicket

Something approach'n
The distance meters

Who dare to a mass as mine?
I punk to bitch men on the street

One constrained to a knife
Juked da-fk out of there

Caz if you call my bluff
Imma bitch-up-outta-there

Best us meet on the move
If you can keep up 
To an American trained by deer

Never call on utter-confidence
To one-on-one with a truth
Only known to the hidden

That math of the equation
Puts me on flight mode

Threw towns & villages
I followed the mountain
By eye-sight

Back-ways-blazed
Horror discover

The church fake
Steeple only garage

Dasdardly-sham

Past hilltops
& More military lands

Miles past wilderness
A track'n dog
Was on a tale

Soon I came to realize
It was on my tail

By power of poles
Like American Deer

Down the hills
To the remote village

Exit one that could
Not be followed easily

Past the ravines
Of two large manors

From the backside
Past great-rocks

That late of day
Paranoid as fk

Look like perfect perch
For some Vampire-deviant

At the bridge 
Over of the dry riverbed

At the farthest white manor
All-borded up tho well-kept

GoPro hasn't worked
Since I tried to film it

Obvious something
Occupied the place

Past lone highway
To the remote village
 
One path led thru tunnel
Only ever go around

Around was a trainyard
Suitable to sleep 
In the across woods

Still 
I had not given-up

Thru the tunnel
Around the bend

Back of monastary
Offered bus-stop shelter

There with no plan
No idea only hope
Of a bus

The same dog
Howled ways off

At the tunnel

It went to the trainyards
Howled again then eventually
Led up to the village

Tracker stop'd before
The tee of the road

I hunked at right-turn
Safe & look'n
From the bus stop

He retreated back
From a pursuit
He had come so far

Myself relaxed-elation

~flop
A agile but long-fall-flop

~da-fk!

Trek'n poles about
To have to 
life-or-death

Sleepless naps
But safe at 4am

Farmer open window
Cat mouths off its 
Frustration 
Left out on a cold rainy night

5:30am Towards main road
A couple at a bus-stop
'Do you know where I am
'Like what town or place is this?

Astonished they ask

'Where did you come from
'Where did you sleep

Myself coy sly'd off direct-answer
They pointed me in the direction

'Because of last night
'I believe in werewolves & vampires

I left them with that

Cows sell out for security
Cats sell out for tuna

Relationships all
Begin with friendship
Now buried in money

Iyo beautiful & free
In the sense of monetony

Next step is the oven

Myself by such
Pulls of fate

A call

I new her at once
Backness of Shadow
Yellow of eyes

Herself anti-state
Who ripped out her organs
Left the forgotten wire
& Still with Kiti-flu

Iyo in thick-cardboard-box
Enraged in a wroth

Return'n to the Humane Society

She worked at the small holes
Enough to get claw by claw out

All existence for one pearl
To scar me for the betrayal

Large dogs
Tails tween legs
Cower'n behind masters

~that cat leashed
~dear-god please be

Instantly 
Purr'n over Ducki
Back in car

Let me wallow
In deepest suffers

Now would be broken
That her dog gone

Hour to hour

Only caz he too scared
He knew I would be mad

Only after myself
Defeated to return home

I exposed
FBI & DEFCON collusion

To betray americans
Lies to entrap citizens

Feed off of it
Money justice

48+ hours 
Had one of them
Been sleep?

Unused convention rooms
Under tables ideal places

To finally get damn-sleep
Cozy & comfortable

A group burst in
Caused drunken ruckus

Security kicked them out
Boss told him to wait
Till he got there
Irate over the phone
For the entire hour

Myself under coffee
Debate'n should I 
Just get out of it?

~hey uh guys
~just was sleeping
~imma just go

Still I kept
Till alone again

& What I seen

Proof of government
Entrap'n citizens
Offical schemes betray
Natural born Constitution

Our first month
Offered to massage her legs
Hypervented in denial

Glorious muscles

On this cute chinese girl

More muscular than myself

Arogant as ever
'let you get in

Laughter compressed out of me
Her tighs around my chest

'Alright alright
'Why you playing

She answered my demand
To retain some pride
With a more-anchored-squeeze

Great muscles
Contracted me helpless

Over & over
Shocked since then

Beaten utterly 
In a fight-for-life
By my own lil wife
_

'If you are a ninja
'& You dont teach me

'That fact would 
'Hurt most of all

I have seriously pleaded
To my wife

Who never teachs me
Tho I give her
Lectures at schedule

Breaths faith into her

No master of my craft
But as puppet I learn

A new way
My own way

Belief into practice
In that ghostly way
Humanity takes as instinct

Its mine vs billions

But to me
The means
My favorite part

'Right 
For me
Too self-righteous
Of a pursuit

From Ether

My Sciences
Taught from unknown

I take a pursuit
Research what options exist

The dive all-in
For whatever I may find

Tried true

Always meant to be

Carried by another will

'Duckie
'You demanded a cat

'We need to go
'To the Humane Society

Sandy Sunday afternoon
I suddenly felt the pull
It was past my control

'Goggle said its closed
Ducki informed me

Proof of untruth

'Lets go to this other one
Things like these were
Better if you only quit
After all options exhausted

'Someone came in last week
'Bought up all the cats
The owner proclaimed

On the way back
Even more low

'Only the offices are closed
Ducki said excitedly

To lift up my obvious
Beaten & fail'd look of despair

Distracted by an
Energetic Calaco

I look up
From the darkness
Of the hole
On the upper-shelves

Yellow orbs appear
A great black-cat
With white diamond
Proudly on her chest

How could one
Majestic as this
Be reduced to free

Ducki named her 
'IO
Cantonese Iyo
Unix input output

IO was
The bitch from the shadows

We took her back
To give her check-up

The worker in haste
Left the metal wires
After strip'n her organs

IO was terrify'n
She believed we 
Were going to return her

Aun all dogs kept away in fear
She tore the the thick card board box
Only enough to release a vengful claw ball

In vicous swipes she would 
Make us remember

Have'n mark'n me
With permenant tatoo

Afterwards embarass'd
~What did you expect me to think
~Whatever it over with move on

IO would perch
Above my hacker desk

When she wanted
Me to blow-off

She would away interested
Over at something else

I once called her on it
She looked bewitched 
At how I understood her
_

Steve, IO's sensei
A most loathesome companion

Bitch from the shadows
Didn't ever have friends

Ducki always with odd talents
Could smell another cat on her

The black cat
That just moved in
Down the street
Short hair'd
& With white diamond
Banner on the chest

That was her 
Seceret boyfriend

We caught them kiss'n once
Down the street

Dream

In the parking lot of a grocer I met a family
They lived in a two story bus

Mom was an engineer
She developed machine creatures thru a furnace technology

They had for sometime been the victim of her creations
Heart of it all lay in the second story breaker

Times I just know what is going on
Family themselves watched as if by entire bus itself

The correct breaker was easily identified
Obvious attempts had been made 

I mouthed out 
~rubber

The mother would not respond and hastily ignored the question
This breaker was like a hot-swap hard-disk-drive

Risking electrocution I used a pair of small-sicssors to pry it out
The vehicle shutdown & the family was out as quickly as possible


In a beat up vehicle on the idustrial side of town we escaped the mother's mechanical creations
The overlord-mind she created in the bus was only turned off

By chance or a greater-force we all ended up in a fenced in building
Metal bars were stacked out side like logs of fuel

They gisltened pure in the sun
To the mother it was a bad sign 

Inside she found an enormous furance
She had built a furance the size of a small box

Now she attempted frantically to disable the furance meters long
Factory employees were first stunned by how much this house-wife knew

Her short but precise choice of words in a reasoning struck them to cmpliance

But it was all too late
All soon became the flight from etermination

Sink-holes opened up like portals around the city
A singular-burning eye of a gaze of fire

Some entity from a far-off sphere by means of workings of higher-dimensions had orchestrated a plan

The intuative mechanical genius of a mother who could relay her understandings of life into a creation birthed mechanical beings
Greedy corporation with a bright-minded scientist created a factory that produced massive-amounts of energy

These two peices were now joined in to an unstoppable production of machines controlled by the eye
Machines like animals hunted all humans

I was alone
Able to hove just over the power lines

Creatures like monkeys followed & grabbed
.
.
.
Life in depths of a rut
Carved day to day
Year after year

Now far from light
Now with no reward

Naught to drive 
Indisputibly

All sacrificed
For one end alone
End once grand

Plagued only with
Testaments it worthless

Friends & happiness
Activities & relations

Regret never part of me
Only open to change today

Drawn to the pleasantness
Of a simple aimless life

you won't be the last

I stay hard
right as the pack of homeless
Thought it was okay 
To check out Ducki
I look each in turn
Dead in the eye
Sorry guy gotta
Keep true my metal

Haunted woods
Bird told me
To turn back

Love songs
Severed questionable relations

Keep it real
Legit all out

When I fuck
A cyclone

Of any available energy
Climax to lay out all
Each energy discrite
In a unison of song

Treasures only rare
Thank all hevans

Better things to do
Most times

Out with bros
Alone see'n sup
Only thing I do

Punk music
Street company

All in 
Only ever

Fk if that
Aint fkd up

All at stake
No sacrifice

Too great an offer
To one god

La Santa Muerte

Let me die
My opinion never
Cost another life

Never a man
Pan boy ever

Go hard
Or fail

Slip & slide
Back bottom

Swamps of fear
Thickets of mediocrity

Plenty enjoyed free
Abundance a constant

Years roll years
Belly rolls chin

Ball over all

Woodland calls

All respectable
Animals know

Unmimicked howls
To identify someone-self

Wilderness has no order
Death at the wake each day

In this understand'n
Nature's society exchanges

Save your flight
I call from far-away
To open sight

Keep as herd
I will keep-on

Mayhap call later
That you know I sure gone

Humanity
Pestilence
Hellish

Aun insects
Open up to me

Wild free me
Way to be
.

Thickets as net
Catches odd things

Once a fawn & I
Cuddled together

From its afternoon-nap
Lets pic together
Not all humans evil
Lets bro out a moment

Train myself
American Deer

Move as they move
Their insticts my instincts
Flight aun wings
Get on by up & over
Till you lost-since

Privledge of poets

Bad habits
Lies of socitey

Vile & degrade'n practice

Acts & passages divine

Pure tabbaco harsh 
Pure menthol smooth

Mixed for delight 
Trademake to ashes

Sleep till past noon 
Responisbility by-passed 

In sacrifice dire experiences 
The long ways that consume hours & hours
In the hardship of an entangled spirit

Blessed by verteran assistance
Run'n from the cops
Pursued by the underlings

Till aun they led 
To the escape of wastelands

That they follow & or know themselves
The true way to freedom

Freedom they were not meant to uncover 
Yet by the wings of indomitable spirit carried

Latent & Potent 
Pools of energy

Discarded by society 
For more productive pursuits

Find the function of my being
Prophet & vessel 

All powers aun lost for a time
Rise with magneficence

My life hand-crafted 
With help of many
Decided alone by me

Deficencies all out
Mar no brillance
Of the whole
.
.
.
Know few people
Write poetry for each
None care to read it
Songs of someone
To be enjoyed 
By others alone

Ronnie my cuz
Booted by the raid

Siege of Ogrimmar

Horde scum beg
Alliance heroes
To rescue them

Hell I'll put in
Only for them to 
Honor me be-titled

Conqueror of Orgrimmar

Garosh fight

~ Khlamidia you are getting us killed
~ But you been with us since the start 
~ All day so we will work hard & not-kick you

who?
Old & marinated in failure

what?
Only ever fail over & over

where?
Jungle too terrible
Privacy too lost

All sacrifice earned
Tombstone of the
Best-forgotten

Each adventure start
Each next decision

Full of fulfillment
Ere is night!

I now bloom
Awkward kept in wait

Till failure
Full-faced

A lesson never overcome
With only two cards in deck

Settle to death
Keep all-out only

Written by fate
Pulled by strings

Play out history
Function of chaos

Curved across into

Walked out to wave

Shaded up

Waving at him

Fella too 
Listened to my story

Return always with

After the adventure
On the streets

Two non-locals
Spot me out

Looked at my legs
Wordless they exchanged glances
One stayed to see
As the other went away

Handsigns
& In debate

Left thumb autonomously
Pressed against meat
Of my other thumb
In definite code

~behind bars
~two locked metal doors

~locals are familiar 
~with this fortress

~best I cast my lot
~out in the wild

Caught as gringo
Going thru town

Went back clear-headed
Fk-it-ill-sleep

Wake in morn
Dizzy & blurry

Moments sort
It is not morn
Its still 2am

Alarmed because
I keep sharp-sleep
Now revealed
Severely blunted

Took off backways
To the Air Strip Beach

Check'n the 6
Check'd tracks
Went to bushes

Wait out mosquitos
With the jungle 
To my rear-escape

After time emerged
Under Large Moon
Bright to a Jungle-bay
Jungled Islands at horizons

Decided a dip
Would be the entire
Reason for my maina

Sure of a time
Fuzzed as if portal
Awoke me after long moments

2am Not to risk this chance

Whatever loves me enough to keep me alive

Blank paper & pen
Nessesary in rite

Chill music
Kashmire
London Symphony Orcestra

Worn-no-day-break
Mastered the core of C
Pointers of memory
Each day I could finish
Something long-since-started

Example being
Esoteric Order of Dagon
H.P. Lovecraft fan-fiction

Only with lose ends
To a rope long-lost
Knotted each end to other

One night off-hand
To flick a few wits
& Have it all unravel

One straight line
One-end-to-other

Life revolved around 
Religion-of-one-self

Cards dropt from deck
Planted Johnny Appleseed

Mayhap if any sprout
Odds are certainly
In my favor

Other day 
Long since many years

Past over a decade
Reworked Tai Chi short-form

Failure what I do
Bleat still out to others

Sheep in a flock
Dumb-shit-richies
Tragic but hiliarious

An epitaph all
Would recognize
Who knew me brief moments
Never forgot memory

Each day
Closer to hell

Heaven not a place
Cozy lame moo-moo-lives

Down I have descended
Pursue freedom & strife 
.
.

People who have heard it
Hundredth even the count

Question only humor the attempt
Each day noah insanity

Ark sunk so there went that dream
Sabatoged more myself
Or bitch-button-smash-hackers

Locals were pretty impressed
With me on my birthday

~gadamn a pig-skin doing here
To earn so many awestrucks
In my card of decks

People sill strong in culture
Only of their streets 
& Back-ways I took liberty

Just like the Lacandonians

Or when they saw me on local-trails

Hands worked vicarious
Energies others donate

In aide to my cause
Regligiously pass-on

Thugs in car chase you
Wreck into another car

Man at first demanded angrily for insurance
Then getting stomped-all-at-once-ruthless

You plead
~! Help me get them off him

~Oh please allow me
I answer the call
Maybe too grogy as passanger in this dream

!!! TROLL !!!

Instantly the man was dropt free

!!! Run Run Run
!!! Up & Over

!!! Don't get caught or hide

~!damn-i-hope-they-dont-know-these-streets

Awakened, perhaps kicked off
I needed to be there to help him
Gage which walls jummpable
Same walls could trap secure

Strengths are impossible to gauge
From a passanger's point of view

Further to increase power
By ethereal mechanics abundant
In Quantum Tunnels as Dreams

For what can be passed
Of more valuable than preservationist-bonds
Intelligence plans experience faith happiness
Various ethereal bounties

Passanger vicarious experience
Summoner aided by experienced

Outrun them all-for-one-self

To the wild

Bellow loud

If you ever met me
Never get I keep it
Always real

Lived cliffhangar

How the fk
Will Richie die?

Several times each season

How will I die?

Each day memory

Out of country
Before I remembered

All night waited

Hook me a local-call
Week since I called

Mainland in
The ghetto of Veracruz

Locale hurdled me
Onto the next shuttle 

Aun I knew it
Going wrong way

Saw all around town 
Decided upon a name
From conversation ride-prior

In the rain
Front a gated-place
Nothing in eyesight

Gatekeeper

~a poor-people-van

Hustled to a great room
Well-worth price

Changed to lobby
Contact wife finally

~Listen 
~You should just be grateful

~Only thankful after

Poisonous leaves

Sacrifice little for the benefit of multitudes

We swordplay 
Attacking me as I passed

To inclose over path
Stuffed leaves

Numbed from jungle-leishons

What is soul worth
Against poetry

Each read less understood

Only action learnt more
Only of difference-language

Opens the gate

To see a miracle
& Just walk
Opposite way

The Solvenian Trail offered tour of country
Weeks I researched it with no reward on how to reach it

Myself found stumbled upon it
Great merryment & prances

Till it led to town
Legit rather tread ahead

No path 
Just north

Untelligble
These stormy days

Over roads,trail,forests,thickets
Fields of crop,military,boulders

Till I spent rainy night
Back against monastary
Rural town of Slovenia

Afraid of Werewolves & Vampires & Russians & Cartel

Started out exactly polar
To the correct way

Street enough to find bus back
To the 10mi+ circle

Pushed ahead despite troll of locals
Myslef in hell of european cafe

Cold & in need of warmth
Coffee a sad-little-swig

Two put me ass-to-gras on mountainside
Rubbed clean shits on lucky rain
Fail to forget shit paper

Only sign seen of Sneznik
Claimed it 30km+

Too far to on water over dry mountains
Dry despite early morn rains & night of fog

Kilometers past where locals said was the path
At a signpost
Sign-post painted Sneznik
Tree over decades grew-around
Enveloping the most important half of the sign

Ahead unhindered by these uncertain circumstance
Now not enough water for return trip
Found myself at a mountain inn next to a fire 
Out of the rain & days-of-stale-pack-food
Bounty of the true miracle this inn
Lesser of the greater miracle I did not get blown off Sneznik
Resolute all-in the summit or death or both

Cruel long life
Drawn torture

Lay in future

All plans
Many & assorted

Worked out
Many times over

None considered today
I bypass first-day 
Blank-page & gratitude

Fear of tomorrow
Where no plan saw

Fat of age
Boils sore

I pop off
To end up

Isla Del Rey
Up over ridge

Sprang both ankles & more
Return trip with boquet in hand

~Gringo driving Mateo?

Local & I chill
He blew me off for 
the time?
Hours passed
Asked to borrow my charger

Chilled out in the rain
Under carnival-tent 
Front `BELA VIDA
He asked for advice

After seeing a sign
Threatened life-in-danger
After defeat over & over

Good for it too
Fresh water crocs
I learned in-habit

Whole town trip
~Dumbass gringo

Streets frontier-side
Where seldom humans go

Best play-fool
Gringo-cloak

Military Police question me
Various occasions
Go thru stuff & machete

Time in the town
More brave than jungle
But it had a shower
& I never found water-source

Locals good-people
Welcome happy faces
Rare world over

Caught guy smoked-of-joint 
To confront me first-thing

First person I seen
As I entered first-time
From the jungle-side

Puss-out depressed
Damn same answer
~You are an idiot
~What the fk?
~That wont work

Jungle vs me
Doesn't make
Round 2

Last attempt

There is a safe way
To go about them

Overfill my cup
Call out Isla del Rey

Get there & have a few
Unexpected adventures

Over areas of maps
Opposite direction
From where studied

Spite mission failures
Birthday gone well

Infinite ocean waves

Sadness of failure
Healthy must bear

Today it echo
Month past

Day-in day-out
Toil toil toil

To make myself
Proud again

To Gros Morne, Newfoundland 

Canada opened to my ways
First time thankful past
Much of my gratitude

Calling out agents
& Taking names as last resort

Caught a lady that shouldn't be there
They pushed me on out & let me in

I hope Canada is better because of me

Canada America's precious hat
America to Mexico body
Brazil pants
Argentine boots

Public late cops
Hassling us

Trying to get something good
To justify their invasion

Police expecting deep-gratitude for no arresting

Made mark on the world
Aun only the piss peed

Caz I sleep in bush
& Shit there as-well

Inner-city to mountain-spring
Toke alone or company

Odd strangers out
On the same remote pass

FreightTrain & I
& Another dude 
City-type no business

Couple told us
Murder
Killer out

Spent night with us
Did not fk with us
At a healty seperatation

FrieghtTrain 
Strong boulder 
Oddly laid top hill

He was likely
More afraid of us

I mostly brandish
Weapons to company

In age-old politeness

He woke up no tent

& Left with us
Back to town

Us two up the mountian
To smoke the next bowl

FreightTrain
ATM denied resupply

Donated my stash of hustle
Largest score of the trip
& Bought him ice-cream-challange

He hustled us free beds at the mansion
Did light chores & enjoyed the score

He had less support than myself
& Wasn't as smart pack-wise
But he wouldn't stop
I seent it more than most

Always kinda puppy-shit-off-me
Pot large enough for two

Once I felt impending-battle
A fight for the treking-poles

We pass top mountain pass
After myself geniously-ahead
Able to rest as he arrived
Knife in palm with spot chosen

Hoosh was missing 
He had his light
& Rumors too

Front a definite charge
But he know true-street
That the last of it
FrieghtTrain my friend

Slept at distance
Past eysight

Humanity gathers in strife
I alienate from it

Redefine existence apart society
Adapt in stregth of primal-ways

Respect the streets
Keep on them on beat

Streets same here
As everywhere
In worse circumstance

Now maped out 
Paths planned
As best in day
Watch always
Aun them sat across

Yet times unexpected
Where wonders lie of lost

Explored before
To make 2am passage
Thru town to jungle beach

Past cove of town
Pleasant waters 

Jungled bunchs of islands
Moon Full & Brite

Beach of dark waters
Waves steady & calm

Handsign & Relic-skull
Baptism of myself
Into the order of self
da-the-fk-that-means?

What I do I do
Definitions 
Dont really define
What I do
Less sane sober

Panama Captian
Who questioned me
& Every other MP
Searched me down
To each bag out

I can tell respect
Kurt Russell muthrfkr
Yours is kept cherished

Panama secret pains
Written but worn-off
Waiting death-to-nothing
Watchman over a squad
Keep those good-people-safe

Out there let them
Pass respectfully
They out here life-on-line
Person just killed yesterday

Perfect arrival timing
Mathematic astrology
Statistics favor me

How often do two people die here
Right one after the othwer

Better rolls than mast
Take that bargin any-day

~Where are you going

Got hustled back again
Embarassed but surprised
How on edge they were

The only other people on the ferry
Government escorted by the MP
I don't fk with forgien cops

~The cantina
'Thats the cantina right
I pointed to the blue concrete-shack

~err I mean I am going
~next to the cantina

~a woman has my room

Captain eyed me as
Don Quijote dumbshit
Almost suspicous zanity

~Go ask them 

I looked up the hill he pointed
& I think he saw the struggle
'My eyes took to meet the demand

Mid-day-full-jungle-double-pack & defeated 
Hours of failure in jungle 
Repelled water-source-less
Liters all drained 
.
.
.
Kid prob thought he could
Take off with my bag

But he was short
Met my stature

Left him with bags
Not without neglect

I left to a taxi for him
Pessimist but I think
That is why he didn't 
Attempt to fk-up-his-day

There I talked with a guy
He put me opitmistic
Over other locals
Who put me as insane
'Good people
'Did logging there

He may have been the one to tell me 
Of yesterday's murder
.

Isla del Rey
Panama

Called out before
Arrived a place

Town only locals
.
.
.

5am Crew up since 4am
Lug packs there from 
Overnight at park 

'El edificio en frente

Lot long to buildings in a cluster

After a while
Crew in a riot

Far-line-of-sight
For enough of the way

They explained it to me
It was the tents in front
.
.
.
I had to pay a local tribesmen
$20 American to use his name
Tribal Lacondonias hungry for tourist
Used name to leverage to juke & escape

Miles into the jungle
Thru thorned nets

In typical single-minded-ness
I spun 900% bound by sharp vines

Tentacle-porn pale to this sight
Blood & lashes paiful light poision
_

Finally caught Mateo
Sleeping at his mothers

Finally without second-thought
As if eventually caught

He got ready to leave
His mother & I talking

As if subtexually gloating
On Mateo's allergy to work

Herself looking at the raindrops
I assured her with my skin better rain
Pleasantly recounted how the stores don't care sunblock

In a boat 
I am a dog
Full frontal glee

Mateo observed this
Envied it to hustle me
To be the firt-mate

Into himself full-frontal-glee
In that exact pose looking side-to-side
Affirmed it a good pose

He took a feather on Pelican Island
~See all that white

I look at him full-of-shit

~They are young pelicans
~Learning to fly

Boated to its shore
Younglings in all places

Motioning their flight in streches on braches
Sqwaks Swaqs Swqaks

One injured ashore
Old at a time to die

I blew my tune to it
A call a wonder to Mateo

Mateo took feathers, lead & line
We went troll'n myself first-mate

Quickly myself able to manuver rest of journey
We hung out with an old-croc-hunter

Village vacat which is extremely odd
For a villiage as this boats-docked

Pleasant waters & awestruck gazes
Americans on a yatch or Locals boated past 
WTF!

Himself diligent in pose
As if the stance fit expected

He was a gentle-man 
& Walked me to the lodge
I alone stayed the night in

Swiftly laid single-bill into his palm
Face iffy a teeter of good or bad

He forgot about me
To double-take on the $50

Face as if full of gold
A look timeless
Sure worth double

Next midday town in celebrations
Myself outside to a corner curb

Kids took him over to me
Mateo drunk as fk since back-when
~Amigo Amigo 
He took me around & inside

But I got the fk out of there
I avoid lots of locals
Women's eyes kill a muthrfkr
Inadverdent but eventual-machete-blade
.

Smile of that girl in Quebec City
A treasure not known-existed memory

Beauty shared openly to stranger
On street-stairs levels up
Back-ways-only-us

Interactionless cept that small token
Taken & cherished by me in devotion

Momentary cohesion a spark
Trigger ways a married-man
Keeps silent without action

When my mother
Takes upon my woman

I sense sub-textual communications
A curse passed as great as blessing 

Relief settles on her mind
Long-prayed requests answered
In a person whose characteristics
Shadowed by the monumentous burden

Synced to a rythmn laid by countless-hours

I remember that taxi driver sent to jail
On questionable justice of his side favored

Looking for a job
Wife on his ass

Out a forest road

By & only by him
3Chop & 3Shot
Able to resupply

Testing my faith

'Leave your bags
'You can trust me

Damn I just lost
My shit all 
Gonna get robbed

Cashed in on fate
He waited outside

Faithful as we
Shop large

Himself have to piss
Middle of woods no where

Caught himself in that karma
Fk-now-I-have-to-trust-them

His brave face mirrored mine
'Well I guess I have to trust you

I thought we should of stole his car
Just to teach him a lesson 

Christina would never agree
Type to break my neck in his-defense

I never pray now
Cept for people
Impossible to aid

After taken much

Breached the end
Turn back it collected

Entire way back night
Sprang both ankles

Boquets not to be stashed

Each flower displayed
From large ridge-meadows

Still to give to my mother
But hell they could be poisionous
Got to test them first

Peeled some

Her a poet

'The secrete to fly
'Is to follow the yawn 

Tai chi as if possessed
She whispered secrets
& pure poetry

Whispers of the dead
Vessel to the infinite
Intention of the passerbys

Her possessed by spurts
Seemed to all else hella insane

Ofuscation of crack to sober
Direct & plainly open to me

She wandered in a restricted area
Kept there as workers exhasperated 

Cracked out

Book of poetry in hand

Hustle opened I exchanged her a $20

Truth spoken without lie
More sober book in hand

Troll Master
Sensitive to emotions
Betrayed over distance

Follow & grasp its throat
A deep & sore pain

Exposed for all
Aun hemisphere away
*
*
*
High with the wild mouse Iyo trapped & I caught
Scared it hid 
I poked it up

We toke out
It assesses the cage
Cleanes itself nose to tail vigorously
Dexterity that puts felines messy
*
*
*
New day impowers new ways
If failure the old-only-dish
Today always best for success
_

Life long injury 
Since before memory

Dr. Yanq Jwing-Ming
Told someone in the way
To tell me directly

Flexibily a core element
Chang Sang-Feng threads
His basis

Next day in discussion
I challenge tense muslces help stability

Later that day
A woman came up to me

'I totally disagree
'With what you just said

Another challenged me
Pointing out my age as youngest

She made a statment
Humbly I awknowldged 
I may be wrong

Act left her 
Nothing-to-stand-on un-expected

In that void kindness
She massaged deep-nested muscles

Taught me the manner of stretch
Locks now freed yet years tense
_

Two weeks later
Half those days
Spent Tai Chi

Woman's technique
Hip now able to explore 360
Socket roll to detect tension
As bridge of issues to upper-body

Areas nagged unsatiated life-long
Burst open to be massaged simply

Today hearld as day alone
Gate of the Hip opened-true

Glorious day never forgotten
Last locked gate thru tai-chi pass

Master of myself
Directed by writ of ancient days

'god knows i tried

At obsessions each day
Amass great swells 

Peaks I be up
Invisible to rest

I seent waves pass
Tidals I'd have floated
If only I had said yes

Sin shrounds me 
Aun glory moment

Yes-man to every idea
Many cultivated whilst high
Till great thickets of bush
Entangle me bound around
Till only escape thru it

After it laugh
Joy in the journey
Just last weeks

Kung Fu Grand Master
Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming

Fate brought us 
To face & depart

Him to me as familiar
Me to him as stranger

Past gold in treasure

Intelligence best found in yokels
Intelligent wasted it in study

Yokels glory the moment
Include me in participation

Iyo soon jealous of the mouse
Mouse in place of resentment 
Interested affection to me

High night after night
Today first cage change
Excitement & grooming

Lets me pet
He can sniff
*
*
*
Expecting hate
Captured all-out

There find friendship
Affection & all its benefits

wild-mouse & I bonded
.

Went to pet store
Of all places 
Entanglements 
To the one down street likely

Only albino feeder mice in closet with feeder iteams

I wail
'this all you got?

He chooses one 
'this one's a female

Wise is passive

Then he puts it back
Gets one

I wail
'is it a male?

He checks several more

I pointed to the mouse that fearless stayed
'that one was the first pick

In a box all the way home
Born for life-sacrifice
For some dasterdly monster

Princess had to be throw
From box to Mousey Manor

Her heart dropped sniffed
To what lair this creature

Too curious for fear to contain
Princess cautious in exploration

Delay Lo-Mo shy
Flipped-to-shit when found her female 

Excitedly his mind exploded with realizations
Princess squeaked at his boldness & I called him a ruffian

Buddy went & chilled out to groom himself
Princess enjoyment of unexpected fortune till sleep

Wild mouse caught by Iyo
Feeder mouse meant for death

Together now inter-weaved
May the union echoe eternally
*

Most people only cross once
Remember me forever
Caz I remeber them
Expected & presented
By me in such light
Eccentric horizons
.
.
.
Reality understands
As first person reality
In another's reality

Dreamt ot learn
Smells mathmatics 

Experience each valuable

Dramatic expeditions
Areas far-from
Only just learnt

Entanglements
Across globe

Tie us each other
Destiny
Result of this bond

Possibility of this
Included me twix

Memorable against

Born for life-sacrifice
Alive in great vibrancy

Life-long wanted this

Create a lifestyle
Mouse trained make & use rope
Bowline trained 

Able to learn to stack huts
Create a mousey network complex

Defined as quantuam passanger interaction

Entangled to need me the Dickie
Sainthood tied to possibility movements

I teach these
They teach others
Others mayhap able
Re-enact what dreamt

Trapped dead

Locals know these structures
Ways-round or thru

Best put myself
Out jungle till morn

Options of fate
Better suited me

Naught even police
Wanted to deal with her

Tho desperate for it
Tried to pull her act on me

She proved her words
Old hobo lady bite her knee

Police got involved
Security kicked her out

I followed her motions
Obvious act of summoning

Upset she in desperation
Called out for whatever

To give her power to confound me
That was when I heard my words

Speak out her mouth
Message of tai-chi-flying

Myself blinded awestruck
Hardly able to remember 

Entering the station boutta-leave
We all cool but she had to keep it up

all cool like imma play the need-hustle

'i know you got 
'please man I need money

I look back-for-real
Never ask too much

I could regardless
But it a principal

Later still stoned
Ideas-brewed-hours

Till now sober
Realise so urgent 
A matter needed action

$20 to get that book of her poetry
Secrets of Tai Chi Flying

Follow the yawn of the ...
What was it?

This all a nexi
To doors of fate

Pateint for opportunity

Lady fed up drag'n her

I stop them 

'Buy that book $20
Cash folded displayed-ready

Lady all not-more-bullshit-plz
Only this last patience left

'Keep your money
'We will get you a book

I un-diverted

'Nah I want that-one

Both broke to other
New found respect 

Had to return twice
In the folds of the book
Left her court papers

Phone ringer off

Missed Dr. Yang 4 times
There for-reals spanish with homeless

Myself looked most 
Overlooked by sifu

Myself wonder'n
Where the fk my ride

No one aun pulled 
Up to the stop
_

I lay a yarn for him

'You should just 
'Pretend your gay
'& get citizenship

European counters not-looking

I advise
'Always good to have an out
_

Travelled since 24 hr
Up at 5:30am

First meet Dr. Yang
To me him as long-since-lost-familiar

He looked back confirmed

'No
'I never met you

I reaffirm

'Well
'That was back when I was 17
'I was a skinny kid

Dr. Yang conceeded

'Well
'You definitely filled in

_

'Javi you look great naked

He allowed great flatter

'Well you know I try

'I mean I was cool with you joining
'But she was shy

I stopped him smiling
Before he could fall too hard

'No not like that

I show obvious

'I called twice out
'You didn't hear?

Javi learnt up

'Oh 
'We thought it came from the other bank

We laugh at misunderstanding
_

Candandian Kung Fu Master delighted

'I will go with you
'Yes you should ask 

Elated in good-fortune

Aside me I approched Dr. Yang

'Would you strike me
'With your whip technique

Dr. Yang on spot declined

'I wouldn't do that to you

I pressed again

'What about 50%

Un-baited I quickly
Backed off gratefully
With respected deserved

_

I get up to wash my plate

Sifu caught me off-guard
Forearm shots one then two

I remained unaffected
Now frustrated till five

'Alright
'you got me

I laugh out conceeded
Sifu in doubt of technique

Now that I had him
Public against ropes

'Would you hit me
'With the whip technique

Swedish blue eyes sparkeled
Happy no un-intentional-offensive given

'Why would you want that

I explain

'To understand the strike
'I would have to feel it

He declined & saved face

'How about I whip
'You with this towel

I back off

'You will rip my nipple off

Everyone up in riot

Sifu puts in defiant
'What it would just
'Twirl around your nipple
'& Then yank off

I proved tested

'Well they are hard now

After-riots-best
_

Japanese girl taught push hands
She took me to her stance

Both arms tested other pong
I complemented amazed

'Your peng is like iron
_

Lil-old-chinese-lady
Allowed me to follow

'I have not done this
'Since I was 17

She lead long-form

Natural techniques
After manner of Master Paul

Aun ahead of her & more-secure in movements

I cocked out after

'Wow
'I haven't done that 
'In like 12 years
_

Lil-old-chinese-lady
Tested herself my cockyness

Push hands she struck
Several trick strikes

None of them near succeeded
_

Dr. Yang chin-na Japanese-girl as example
She tooked the pain ungrateful

He called me as last lesson

wrist elbow shoulder

Busy in lesson
Remained unaffected

To which he let slip later in lecture
Sign of the old-school-style-student
_

I was informed 
Dr. Yang hardly seen & lectured

This week he lectured every morn & afternoon
Person awknowledged myself reason
_

Dr. Yang birthday party
I flung up right
Eyes on each other
Quickest all know sup

_

Dr. Yang lamented at his student

'He say 
'I retreat superior 
'But am left myself strike-less

Dr. Yang disappointed

! You got to position
'Retreat into a counter-position
_

Dr. Yang told his life-tale
An honour treasure of lifetime
A Fable glorified self-taught
_

Dr. Yang
As he always was all those times
Yet only fleeted moment ever past
_

Dr. Yang
Turned away citing San Feng

'Flexible as necessary

Polite comment to another
Yet directed to me

Classy

Next lecture I countered

'Tesion allows endurence & saftey

Classy he took my unclassy confrontation
'all in moderation
_

Dr. Yang explained root
_

Javi

'You know Paul B...

I look back 

'huh

He walked me thru

I jolted

'You know Paul my master

Javi counteres shouldn't you know that?

'I haven't seen him since when I met Dr. Yang

This manuscript details the machine of MKRX unix networks
A network of connected nodes thru tunnels shrowded by pre-shared-key encryption
Each node is a clone with minimal customizations
#####################################################
Mission: Accumulate, rate, & disperse files in secret

Users acquire keys via interaction with HIVE daemons that live on the HOST system
Users initate a job, the daemon works the que, the user gets a key
Keys can be rated over time to be deposited into the user bank in the WORLD

Job example:
  1) chicksnuff has daemon scrape usb
  2) daemon tags each file entry with chicksnuff
  3) HOST verifies each file for uniqueness
  4) HOST is notified per-file by network on REP (dl_cnt, stars, value)
  5) HOST pays out keys as dividends to user

Unique file is introduced by a user on a HOST
HOST introduces the file to the network
Network rates the file which benefits the HOST even if file has moved to another
HOST in turn benefits the user
User is anonymous to the network
User can then MARKET HOST keys for another HOST
#####################################################
Network Value is contained in 4 sectors
  {#} Storage shares         - node file count & quality 
  {#} Process clones         - HIVE independent & dependable
  {#} Cryptographic Security - OTOPSKOPIE authentication
  {#} Services               - ssh scp irc ftp http

#####################################################
Each node of the network consists of HOST-kernel, jail-worlds & users-accounts
HOST   - physical machine node
  lord - account associated to a ring of power only accesible via WORLD heir account
ANONI  - jail where all traffic spawns
  tmp  - account to be wiped upon disconnect & associated with a OTOPSK
TROVE  - jail which serves anonymous-scp SICC files
LOG    - jail which serves log files only accesible by seers
WORLD  - jail user accounts
  norm - unprivledged user & unable to escalate power
  seer - norm user with ability to scp logs from LOG
  heir - norm user with the ability to ssh into HOST 
#####################################################
Normal User Connection Example:
1)  user opens connection by sending One-Time-Only-Pre-Shared-Key [OTOPSK] to a HOST 
       => external traffic open to spy via ip4 HOST
2a) HOST redirects connection via Packet Filter to ANONI jail
       <= => internal service traffic enshrouded by encryption 
2b) upon disconnection ANONI jail wipes tmp acct
3a) user can One-Password-In-Everything [OPIE] into WOLRD to access account
       user => ANONI => internal ssh => WORLD norm
3b) user can OTOPSK scp into TROVE 
       user => ANONI => internal scp => TROVE files
3c) seer can OTOPSK scp LOG
       seer => ANONI => internal ssh => WORLD seer => scp LOG
#####################################################
Lord User Connection Example:
1)  lord opens connection by sending OTOPSK to HOST
       => external traffic open to spy ip4 HOST
2a) HOST redirects connection via Packet Filter to ANONI jail
       <= => internal service traffic now enshrouded by encryption 
2b) upon disconnection ANONI jail wipes tmp acct
3)  lord OPIE into WOLRD to access heir account
       lord => ANONI => internal ssh => WORLD heir
4)  lord OPIE using WORLD heir into HOST
       lord => ANONI => WORLD heir => internal ssh => HOST lord
#####################################################
Summary: 
The ANONI jail method external spy can not distinguish traffic nor user.
Most imporatant the HOST has only to control ANONI to control access

# 1 - SICC System In Complete Chaos File System
####################################################

# Overview #########################################
Storage shares are the most important factor in this network
Archive-oriented structures are implemented as a network-wide pursuit of unique files

Write-only dump-dir 0300 /usr/nfs/dump/
This directory will be scraped by the SICC-system periodically into /usr/nfs/pub/

(this exposes files to an nfs-share mountpoint to the network for file exchange)
SICC will process all files into a sane manner built to handle massive numbers

Storage has a next important factor is entropy strength
Entropy is stored to be traded with other hosts

Entropy over-time multiple-source random-selection
Each Private-Key stored as its sha

To sum up
Data is kept as a sea such that the listing freeze a system

Obfuscation by explicit filename requests
Random-parts of random-files in hexadecimal order with no association

To piece together the file
  [:D] - Metadata file
  [:D] - KEY file
  [:D] - shape pool
  [:D] - KEY$ payment
# NAME SYSTEM ######################################
The core of this system is based on sha file computation

Sha is a unique file identifier that is the output of a mathematical algorithm
This mathematical algorithm will produce the same sha for the same file

Each file is named after its sha

This name system has two benefits:
  {1} de-duplicates files
  {2} assigns data into chaotic order

Sha uniqueness keeps all data:
  [-] simple
  [-] homogeneous
  [-] ultra-transient

The duplication of data is accounted in lists
Each data-pool is maximized in its ability to minimize the data-pool's disk-footprint

The duplication count allows for network backup prioritization to remote devices
This foundation is stable for automated backup management of massive-distributed-data
# METADATA #######################################
Metadata is kept isolated from data
This isolation allows for the obfuscation of open data

Data-pool lists have lessened-value without Metadata
Exposure of lists can be nullified by salt

Only someone that has the metadata & access-key can request data

This file-system is built for ultra-transient network management
All files are located in the directory "/usr/nfs/pub/"

Two factors assist in obfuscation
  (1) No subdirectories to betray association
  (2) Alpha-numeric ordering of the hexadecimal names

The path allows for past-association to be deduced for group-reconstruction
Each file is periodically verified to have a corresponding metadata-file

Each metadata-file consists of 4 lines:
  (1) name - XS (MKRX) standardized name
  (2) path - XS standardized path of extraction
  (3) size - number of bytes
  (4) encode - type of encoding
# KEY ##############################################
A KEY is a recipe to rebuild an obfuscated file

This allows for a powerful layer of unprecedented obfuscation
What is public gibberish is made private information thru access to a KEY file

Each KEY file is named after the original file sha
The KEY file contains sequential sha-per-line lists

Obfuscation Methods:

  [X] shaper (secure against file-known)
        Shreds a file into random-sized parts & creates KEY
        Random-size prevents sha rainbow-tables of attacker with file-known

  [X] BLKR (insecure if file-known)
       Shreds file into standard-sized blocks & creates KEY
       Homogeneous data types will have duplicate-collisions which nullify the duplicate data
       Only one copy of data can exist in the data-pool
       Many KEY files can correspond to the same block reducing the data-pool disk-footprint
       The smaller block-size the greater power of compression & obfuscation of data-pool
       Each node configures own block-size
# SUMMARY #########################################
This file-system spread over a network has the following benefits:
  [o] All data easily accounted for in simple lists
  [o] Sane & clean orders of massive-data on an network
  [o] Network level explicit control of the duplication of data
  [o] Each node serves what is possible
  [o] Each node has access to total data
  [o] Each node can assist in external backups
  [o] Total network-pool footprint is minimized

On a homogeneous unix kernel the network file-system is transparent
Only active tunnels will be displayed as available data-pools

Transparent file-system
  [l] store data remotely
  [l] get a remote file
  [l] serve a local file
  [l] backup network to local drive

# 1 - MKRX
####################################################

# Overview #########################################

MKRX is built as node-host-clone to archive massive amounts of data
Nodes enhance the network & recieve amazing benefits
Node service & contributions are repaid with the contributions of the whole

MKRX Tools allow the clean & stable foundations for this ecosystem
The user interface is thru the command-line over a network

# MKRX Tools #######################################

MKRX Tools:
  [XS]
    Extract & Standardize
    Recursive file copy processed by metadata extraction & isolation into ordered ZFS pools
    This duplicated a pool to pass only unique file data in a minumum-sized disk footprint

  [SCRUB]
    Verify if sha of file matches the filename
    This alerts the system to any inconsistencies
    Alerts help keep the temple pure

  [CHKMETA]
    Confirm each file has metadata
    This keeps a tightly-clean organization

  [UNIQ]
    Output unless (ARG1-files exist in ARG2-files)/
    This is a nifty program which is used in all facets of administration
    It compares a linked-list of data to the other and outputs all inconsistency
    perl hashes transform this project mathematically to reduce a weeks-long process into minutes

  [XFR]
    Serve data to local drive
    Serve data to remote locations

  [INDEX]
    Build Metadata hash-dumps that are clean data structures for user interface
    This greatly minimized CLI initialization

  [CLI]
    Load INDEX hash-dumps into memory
    Terminal Input & Output produce single-entry lists

  [CENSUS]
    Combine all host_LIST into a community-census
    OUTPUT:>sha host1 host2 host3 ... hostN

  [LONE]
    Clone a undupe file from CENSUS
    INPUT:>sha host4
    OUTPUT:>sha host4 host11

# XS ###############################################

Extract & Standardize All Files Recursively
  Send a foreign data tree to pool-dir grabbing all files
  Build metadata in an isolated place from the data

This process is the gateway for files to enter the archive
High io usage & multiple process utilization

Features the expert developer kent\n
This code been worked over 100s millions of files

Automatic logic
Just point & pull trigger

Name & path values are standardized to keep environment safe
The path allows for past-association awareness
Size & encoding keep calculations one-time-only

# UNIQ ############################################

Output if ARG1 does-not-exist in ARG2

Filter data that is unique on the network
Compare NODE-list against NET-list
Backup the network with priority files needing duplication

This is a very useful command
It can handle millions of iterations in both ARGs

Learn the simple code mechanic & this command will prove a general system tool
In minutes this processes data that would require many days for grep

# CLI ############################################

Interface to network archive requests custom file requests
This is a daemon server that keeps METAMASTER in memory
Transactions are hexadecimal arrays

  [1] Build INDEX hash-dumps into memory
    This may take several minutes due to massive-data

  [2] Build array-list
    Set to network array-list
    Load a custom array-list from file

  [3] Filter down array list
    Use perl regular-expressions to parse patterns

  [4] Report on array-list
    Print a filtered array to file
    Count the quantity in array-list
    Output the corresponding array-list value
      name, path, size, encode

  [5] Create lists of files bound to a byte-parameter
    The calculation of sums add up when it is to the millions
    Array-list is sectioned into specific-sized chunks

  [6] Use XFR to request the files into home directory
    This process will only require a feed of the output which is the array-list
    Array-list will always only be the sha of filtered file-metadata

  [7] Use conditional regular-expressions to edit the array-list names into a new-file
    After XFR complete use new-file to rename array-list files

Command Menu:
  {regx}  regx data filters
  {reset} reset array to full network-array
  {load}  load array from custom file
  {print} output current array to file
  {count} count array
  {value} output values of array 'name, path, size, encoding'
  {pop}   output size-specific lists that sum to a specific-amount of bytes
  {name}  edit name using conditional regx into new-file

# EXAMPLES #######################################

[1]
Create GET for backup
  {TOTAL_NET}   location of network-wide file list
  {TOTAL_LOCAL} location of local file list

# DISK #############################################

Two types of storage
  [r] - root storage
    This is a location that resides upon a root-file-system of a kernel
      /usr/nfs/pub/
  [r] - flat storage
    An external disk that contains only an imported pool of files
      /37w/pool/ or /usr/nfs/37w/pool/

/usr/nfs/pub/  - zfs mount
/usr/nfs/373/  - nfs mount
/usr/nfs/y7u/  - nfs mount

External-drives are necessary for clean access to a file-system
A foreign system can port-itself to mount the simple zfs file-system

The root storage is only slightly more complex
A trade to only then need a amd64 machine architecture to start up


/zroot/boot/ - lord only privilege
---------------------------- DESCRETE LINE
/usr/nfs/pub/ - zfs quota protection
/usr/nfs/el1/ - nfs mount
/usr/nfs/z87/ - nfs mount

# 2 - HIVE
####################################################

# OVERVIEW #########################################
Network TXN (transactions) are based on KEY$ currency
Creating & trading private-keys as a means for network access

Usr sends unstable-input to HIVE
A DEMON stablizes-input & computes
HIVE deposits payment into usr bank
Usr buys host-keys & trades them for specified-host-keys

Each heart of each node singular in the aim of Archive
Data stored for the future & it will offer refuge to any helpful

Encode bounty * group-multiplier = payment
Payment is exchanged for group-limited private-keys

Private-key will be used to open a tunnel
Pre-Shared-Key One-Time-In-Everything
_

Massive projects will be broken down into iterative-tasks
Usr will work DEMON upon sections of those iterative-tasks

Two quest areas
  ["] - harvest of novel workloads lists
  ["] - compute lists

Each project will be distributed to array-computation

project / network-nodes = time
  time + network latency = total-time

Benefits of network-sync-computation
  Randomize Entropy Sources
  Scrape data off from many sources to not cause attention
  Shred data into random-sized blocks
  Clean up host into network dump
  Allow many users to contribute metadata to Archive Collections Interface
  Distribute loads from disk to network to cpu to disk... to empower robustness
  Health-Beat of host via dtrace anchors

A network of DEMON (unix daemon) work on a schedule
  Busy (low all)
    Scrape http data

  HICC - fail / error
  BURP - cat log of successful iterations
  FACE - echo DEMON portrait
  REIN - iograph of net & individual data
  BARK - { [PING * ALLOWANCE] < 10%_expected }
  SUICIDE - clean-up then kill-itself

A HIVE cumulative workload should never breach 20% of maximum
The goal behind this work is to allow sanity thru dissociative-scheduled-massive-computation of a network of these HIVE

# NODE #############################################

A unix daemon is an process that severs all-but-explicit interface file descriptors
This provides an independence which stabilizes the foundation of the code
This code is a summon-scroll crafted to deal with specific actions
  The process can be suspended-shutdown-update_que by an admin able to write in a locked-down dir
  The DEMON-INTERFACE will all specific tasks in an explicit command execution

The Achilles heel of distributive computing are fork-bombs & defunct-muthrfkrs
Fork bombs are nasty & bloom out of any inconsistency [like invasive network probes]
Defunct processors are unkillable in certain situations
You can never automate continuously running programs without a sensitivity to host health
There is a reason animals have a nervous system & we must forward those lessons onto the machine race
The sensitivity of the host system will be the stable foundation with catches fork bombs
  Every host will have an avatar maintained by HIVE
  This will be a depiction of the health which will have numerical value
  If any net-process over 50% utilized-cpu then cleanup & exit or sleep

Full-access given to any network node with proper Pre-Shared-Keys Once-In-Everything-Passwords
This allows a network to be delegated remotely to partitioned unix groups
  pig_fkn_redneck wants a torrent downloaded at maximum-strength crypto
  The code will inspect the PSK, shift the key off the array, and have x proxy nodes download the file in pieces
  When the torrent is complete, verified & archived it is placed in /usr/home/pig_fkn_redneck/torrent/Udders_for.udder.lovers.mp4

# FUNCTIONS #########################################

tombstone() name() time()
Each DEMON has a unique name that will be memorialized with its lifeswork
For a member to enrich the whole, first the society must cherish the member
The tombstone is a snapshot of the last DEMON portrait FACE

que_r() que_up() que_flush() api_verify()
QUE for work is placed via nfs into the node specific folder /HIVE/node/$host/que/que-file
que_r() reads the directory, skips . & .. then returns the next value as the que-file
que_up() reads the que-file into an array then deletes it
Life must have a stable state due to its unpredictable nature
que_flush() is the mechanism to ensure that a state is kept by TODO que-file that cycles
api_verify() checks the que-file is digestible for the HIVE environment
All que-file that fail the check will become zombies and must be beheaded (head -n 1) & replanted

# 3 - NET
####################################################

# OVERVIEW #########################################

# P2p^n ############################################

Network of P2p^n nodes
  host  : uniq identifier
  LIST  : sha list
  REG   : TXN register
  DNS   : tunnel routes

# DNS
$host $ip4:$port

Example:   4uu 23.123.231.30 22 ssh
           y43 37.12.33.42 6660 irc
           ii3 37.12.33.42 6661 rsh

A user connects to a host via OTO-PSK to an anonymous user of that tier
Then the user can:
  OPIE into another user
  purchase zfs quota
  nfs tokens
  ftp
  http proxy
  irc proxy

# REP ##############################################

All entities in NET have a REP
Transfers of REP is in a community-wide register

host_alice : host_bob host_ben host_bill
[ a register all subscribe to by P2p^n communities ]

TXN registers each transaction
$date $host_witness $from $to $amount

This creates a simple end-of-day-balance
$usr $balance

All data are sent to REG
This will sha log

The currency of the network are file sha
Data value of the file appraised by community

This is exchanged into value
The value will change but this is discussed later

# GUILD ############################################

GUILD are groups in the network
    vatos_hostalice              vatos_hostbob
           vato_bill >                 vato_proxy: quota bank key
           vato_ben  >
           vato_paul >

BANK GUILD host_representative meet to exchange data
  BANK increases value
  Exchanges keys value to host_rep
  host_rep passes that on to usr
  usr can TXN the value at AH

Each file is on the master_file
sha usr cur_usr
dental.pdf ry4l titty

Value of the sha approved for community value
Originator gets 70% increase Current-Owner gets 30%

# IRC ##############################################

OTO-PSK access to channels
Channels are secured rooms of communication

# EXAMPLE 1

#BANK "bots only"
bots wait for all members to join
Secondary mechanisms of authentication passed

They meet to exchange msg all log
They agree on the sha of the log
Then adjourn the meeting

MEMBERS:
  node_rep    - relations with other nodes
  ah_bot  - transactions
  guild   - power
  archive - value sha

# EXAMPLE 2

#AH "auction house"
usr /msg menu_bot "list"
menu_bot: $id $amt ...

usr /msg menu_bot "buy $amt"
>>ah_bot: key

>>usr sends key to banker
>>banker sends confirmation

>>usr /msg ah_bot "$key $confirm"

usr /say "$id"
ah_bot /say "$TXN $buyer $seller $amt $id"

usr /msg ah_bot "refund"
ah_bot: refunded $amt

# 4 - KERN
####################################################

# Overview #########################################

FreeBSD 10.3 kernel is hardened & customized to provide a homogeneous network-environment
The power of unix is its ability to clone increases the network cohesiveness with the intricateness of the clone

  [z] - program install
  [z] - configuration
  [z] - users & groups (section 4)

The system is off-line installation till PSKOPIE
USB is loaded with pre-worked tarballs of sourcecode

Configuration purify the integrity of the unix-hull
Users & groups form the columns that keep structure

Triple-Layer-Security
Password keys must be Pre Shared Keys Onetime Password In Everything
Each account is associated with a jail account access that is periodic
The unix kernel is sterilized & monitored over the network

Configurations are default to brick
BRICK will load decrypted-configuration into dtrace-sensored-memory

Authenticated & anonymous log view
OTO-PSK key-based log access to node
(top iostat zfs ps tcpdump)

# PROGRAMS #########################################

Pre-load the USB with programs to be made available by default
  (1) go to the /usr/ports/ program directory
  (2) make fetch
  (3) sanitize configure file
  (5) insert program into USB install code
  (4) if test then tar to USB

perl-modules
  LWP::Protocol::https

unix-packages
  perl5
  bash

# CONFIGURATION ####################################

sysctl.conf
  [p] - Restrict owner-only process view
  [p] - Restrict member-only group view
  [p] - Tighten network settings

rc.conf
  [p] - Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)
  [p] - Gateway will determine address & uses that as subnet external-interface
  [p] - Hostname is a uniq 3 character identifier
  [p] - Kernel modules loaded
  [p] - Services are started
  [p] - System options set

pf.conf
  All network pipes are structured thru this configuration
  Tables allow for each node to be synced to the other with approved lists
  All tcp communications are hardened with reassemble scrubs
  Traffic is blocked-silent unless there is explicit approval
  Proxy tunnels are established thru net-lists
    [q] source_interface
    [q] destination_addr
    [q] port
    [q] usr

start_if.
  This will mask the MAC for network communications
  This mask is imperative to network security

ttys && login.conf
  Remove direct root access
  Require root-password to single-user-mode

ntpd.conf
  OpendBSD built ntp server to sync all nodes
  There is no external-ntp-server
  All NODE sync to the other

# JAIL #############################################

FreeBSD jails are the disposable grounds of the system
User accounts are tied to a jail that has access to an NFS mount

Jails are periodically turned this requires
  [d] PSKOPIE associated only with certain dates implementing a 3rd security layer
  [d] The jail is then destroyed & created again with a sha verified image

This implements a Memory-Disk-like environment changed to persist on reboot

# KEY-UPDATE ######################################

/usr/home/usr/.ssh/id_rsa
/usr/home/usr/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Usr accounts have a finite lifespan
Time added at cost that is reduced upon time-in-relation of the host-system

# KEY$ ############################################

First, to communicate with the network the PSKOPIE KEY$ must be obtained
Kernels exchange files & services for KEY$ that are a fluid source with a finite-lifespan

Elliptic-curves are used in a random array which each kernel mines periodically
KEY$ are then exchanged for increased file-sha on their list

Registers account each transaction of a node,  a unique file can only be on one register, each section of the file a sha-confirmed states
  (1) REGSTR( past + add -  ded )
  (2) {jan-mar} = $sha
  (3) "ALARM" unless (cat REGSTR | grep [jan|feb|mar] | SHA == '$sha')

A usr puts in a QUE-bid for a DEMON which relies on host-load to process
If the output is acceptable output the usr is rewarded with credits it buys connections with

Available kernel KEY$ on a host
{ host } { host } { host }
| KEY$ | | KEY$ | |      |
|_...__| |_...__| |______| . . .

# MARKET ##########################################

KEY$ are exchanged p2p
  [B] SELL - sell uniq data to kern in exchange for token
  [B] XFR - transfer KEY$ for KEY$


KEY$ are managed like stock
The more valuable the host access the more valuable the KEY$

(1)
//zr9\\ ---- $sha_of_unique + zr9_KEY$ ----> //8n8\\
(2)
//8n8\\ ---- $sha_of_unique + zr9_KEY$ ----> //55q\\

Access to a host if dervived from the network can only happen from lengthy & positive actions

KEY$ are updated on witness of three others
Five sha are confirmed the same & published in a broadcast update

All nodes write broadcast to log
Conflicts will be dealt with noticeably

KEY$ that are inconsistent lock that equal amount in auto-buy
This allows for the system to be adaptable to mistakes in code

This is a system of key wealthy nodes
To prosper all one has to do is improve services

NODE make massive-key trades after a value of NODE
The least inconsistent-locks the more value the KEY$

Incentive to pay for trustworthy-nodes to increase value of TXN

tip witness KEY$

6u8 => 1T KEY$ => 7tw
  Witnesses
    mk1 88r q8l
  XFR worth triples to 3T

This helps centralize efficency the system
But does not detir decentralized transactions

The host modifier is variant in grade of positive bonus onto the TXN
The acient houses empower themselves with longstanding service


norm has to que
lord has no que

NODE has 10000 stock
As the NODE increases in value to the network each stock increases

SPLIT: when a node doubles in value

1000000 is actually 10000 invested ports

Portal out of limbo
  [u] USR -> PSKOPIE -> port
  [u] port -> PSKOPIE -> usr

A port account is a sleep'n gate keeper
It is only woken when asked-for

This allows for several thousand direct-portals open
Yet at the same time requires null resource

USR holds stock xf71038 a year
After USR gets access into the port
port PSKOPIE use
The USR su 'boobnorm'
norm PSKOPIE use
cd ~/

0i3 -> PSKOPIE_SET accounts -> SELL pool
48o -> BUY 0001norm@0i3 stock -> CLAN bank

0i3 Host nfs 6mo & doubles in timeout-length
48o CLAN bank -> 0001norm@0i3 -> double length logins

It takes 1 month of positive activity
To become worth the exchange to a single stock

File worth:
  [c] prime
  [c] second
  [c] third
  [c] fourth - unverified file

This is the incentive to hold a unique file of value
To own that prime & hold it or sell it hot

Local storage or net-trade
bob_3y89d rents space for prime file storage
  + net salary
  + usr rent income

Use of remote nodes is useful & encouraged
Nodes offer transient storage for the BLK_CLD of files

# 5 - PF
####################################################

# Overview #########################################

Packet Filter is a raw-packet pipe system
Ports & Source-Address pairs are there connected

Raw-packet pipe systems allows for the simplest form of action
Data that transacts there is read & manipulated pure from 3rd-party-code(government-device-malware)

tcpdump analysis & parsed-output is PSKOPIE posted over the network
[ pflog is read via tcpdump ]

# XCOM #############################################

eXplicit COMmunications kept the hull of the network tight
A solid object is formed as expertise grows

No packet is passed unless it is explicitly-allowed to an explicit-host that is SSL verified
Anti-Middleman techniques used at the network & kernel level

All TCP transactions are scrubbed & reassembled
The subnet behind the NODE is disguised as the node
MAC-addresses are all masked on the network

# TABLES ############################################

Tables are files the system uses to lookup hosts to pass
SSL sockets confirm the identity of the host

(CAPTN_CONFIG discussed later)
Privileged nologin accounts sha-confirm then load the addresses
Approved-list -> sha256 -> post to network -> network confirm -> load list
If the sha does not match the network the table is not loaded

All usrs approved on the network share the same tables
Every usr knows the identity of all other users securely

The configuration memory is sha-verified to confirm identity
Each new connection must have a pre-shared-table & PSKOPIE

# USR ##############################################

pf allows for a network to pipe data by usr accounts
All accounts are preset & pre-shared to keep the network clean, simple & stable

# 8 - Hardware Schematics
####################################################

# Overview #########################################

# BIOS #############################################

BIOS is like loving a women
You have to go thru the labor of investigation

  [i] BIOS button [f2] || [f12] || ...
    This button will drop the system into BIOS as a hotkey
  [i] Boot
    Find the drives
    Select the boot drive
    Activation of SATA ports is required on some BIOS
    To learn your machine you must roam the BIOS
  [i] SATA
    The motherboard sata-port position may affect the boot of certain motherboards, try each motherboard SATA port if troubleshooting

# CPU ##############################################

High-power-cores for beefy processing
Multi-quick-cores for mass of calculations

Unix & MKRX keep the system simple
Low-power massive-pool are favored over next-lvl-computation

Bottom-line is if you know why you like your CPU
That is all the only standard which you need
To have that boost-output respective to system-specs

# RAM ##############################################

ECC ram is the best ram because why not have hardware-verification
RAM is the perfect mate for ZFS even if it is desktop ram

The better the admin the more need for RAM
MKRX systems is very RAM heavy
Plus cpu time is heavy loads if left unchecked

SPEED HIERARCHY
cpu-cache -> ram -> pci-ssd -> sata-ssd -> sata-hdd -> usb -> net

# BOX ##############################################

Hold 1 / 2 drives
1 SSD
  Quick root filesystem & network access
1 HDD
  Slow but beefy storage

There are several forms of DISK CONNECTION
Use these options to maximize a NODE build

Each motherboard has its ways
To the hacker it may give you headaches
To the scrub it will make you give-up

BIOS specific experience best learned-once
Lessen the diversity of motherboards in a same-admin-network


# DISK CONNECTION  #################################

Kernel requirements to use the hard-disk-drives (HDD)
  [a] Power pin secure to the HDD
  [a] SATA cable secure attached to HDD
  [a] Recognizable File System || overwrite

POWER
  HDD are powered by a pin that can be daisy chained as a power source
  HDD do not require much power and this can allow a node to increase in size
  Drives are not power-hungry but a 1000W Power Supply Unit keeps a box robust

SATA-HDD
  All amd64 motherboards contain an L-shaped port
  A male/female cable will connect the drive to the motherboard

PCI-SATA-HDD
  PCI cards can come from 1-4 SATA ports which add onto drives connectable to the motherboard
  PCI-SAS + PCI-SATA + mobo = many ports

PCI-SAS-HDD
  These use break-out cables that split one into four creating 8 SAS connections (SATA)

JBOD
  ZFS needs the drive to be passed raw free from hardware-raid interventions
  Each raid-card has their own BIOS to search for the JBOD option
  Be sure because if you are wrong you are fkd

USB-SATA
  External-drives in an array with external-power-source
  Modularization & beef up  on a low transaction host
  Power-strip + USB ports + shelf

LSI-SAS-9211-8i
  Preferred Host Bus Adapter
  Direct-disk-passthru-no-bullshit
  Never daisy-chain SATA-data cables
  16 is the expected maximum from the 9211
  This leaves mobo & pci-e sata ports available
  If more than one ZFS pool exists on a mobo - mix disk sources
  8-wide-raidz2 => 4 on hba1 4 on hba2
  7-wide-raidz2 => 4 on hba1 4 on hba2

Hardware-raid-card
  Most raid cards have an option JBOD (just-a-bunch-of-disks)
  Read the manual to see if a direct passthru is possible
  zdb report out the disk-ids to verify individual disk identities
  Only if this succeeds (&&)
  Create a ZFS file system

# RAID ###############################################

Raid can be a beautiful thing
They are always true muthrfkrs

Hot-swap is the act of precariously recalculating pool-parity after drive-failure
First the physical-location must be known a trial of hardship for white-box-hackers

Despite finished efforts of mapping still: drive-failure + physical-location = complete nightmare

If one drive fails the recalculation of parity will overwork the pool
If another drive fails the pool is mostly toast
This a cliff I have myself stared down

The beauty of simplicity should always be carried out before a raid-array attempted
Very easy to setup but when SHTF they are the worst to deal with

raidz3 at 15 drives wide nears the efficiency of a raidz2
I have run one 3 years without a need for hot-swap or error
NFS serving 75%+ data pool

# 10 - SCRAPE
####################################################

Internet hosts fields of information as free forages
The extraction of data is unique to individual fields

Massive-Iterations worked-over-time
Various host sources is ideal

Steps
  [1] - grab html pages that holds addresses of data
  [2] - filter only the addresses that are useful into a queue file
  [3] - work over the queues in a light-weight-sleepy-http_get request

[1]
Find the lists of data-items
This takes several probes of investigation

The ideal location is an incremental-address
  https://artgallery.yale.edu/nodes/0
  https://artgallery.yale.edu/nodes/1
  https://artgallery.yale.edu/nodes/2

Deposit these html-files in a designated directory

[2]
This is normally where the locals get clever to hide the data
Only by tracing normal-access, can the scraper figure-out the formula for filters

FORMULA
  [f] - unique-regx-pattern as the start of the address-of-data
  [f] - unique-regx-pattern as the end of the address-of-data
  [f] - unique-regx-pattern as the front cut-off-trim to the address-of-data
  [f] - unique-regx-pattern as the end cut-off-trim to the address-of-data
  [f] - concatenate the addresses-of-data to a queue file as a full-address-of-data

Move html-file to a processed-only-directory only-if there was an extraction of a address-of-data
A review of the formula & the failed-extraction-html-file will improve the formula

A formula must be created for each project
A formula has to be found once per project

[3]
Split the queue of the workload into appropriate-segments
Read each segment then remove it from that directory

Work over each segments only after sleeping the process for a short time
Sleep is necessary for client-machines, server-machines, & all-in-between

Perl http-get-request
  LWP::Protocol::https
  LWP::UserAgent

  my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(agent, "donkeytrain/54.0.1", from, "punxnotdead", timeout, 45);
  $ua->get($address, ':content_file'=>$file);

###### ESOTERIC ORDER of DAGON

! Clank clak clik
Todd ran his hand down lockers lining empty-halls

15 Minutes past the bell
Point-of-no-return to class

Any student this late gets writ-up
Ironically worse than not arriving to class at all

`Devil has idle hands when works harvest
Todd inspired himself to no avail

His purpose in the basement
Below, front the door he planned to open 

Latency became mounted by endless-anticipation
Energy from day-dreaming now a hurdle
Aun compelled him towards the opposite direction

Thump of Todd's feet steady
Step-after-step up stairs to higher floors

A peace appreciated
A place only-ever bustling

The few rays of sun bore thru
Only to expose dust-polluted air
_

Mellow ambience shattered
Patters of running-feet charged towards his direction
From around the corner

Fortune placed Todd directly-opposite the girls-restroom

Distance leapt in one bound
He rushed to the last stall

Todd let out a cocky smirk
An instictual-ingenuity to hide in the girls

!! KAK

Cracked-seat Todd stood atop broke
Left-foot plunged ankle-deep into hour-old piss & shit

Door quietly opened
Someone made an attempt to open the first stall

A muffled-yell came from the hallway
'BEN WE KNOW YOUR IN THE GIRLS

!! BOOM

Heavy-legs-kicked-open-near-cracked-the-door-in-half

The unexpected-fright broke unprecedented-pressure into full-release

!!! BRAPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSS
!!! PPPPUUUPPPPTTTTTUUUUPPPPP
!!! PPPPPLLLLQQQQQQIIIPPPLLLUUUUKKKKIII

Entire school vibrated
Eruptions of great-masses expounded essays

!!! GAWDDAMN BEN
!!! YOU SHOULDA SAID WHY
!!! YOU NEEDED tHe gah hiRls

A schoolhall-monitor hooted out for-the-entire-building-to-know
Announcement gagged-quiet
Gas particles bloomed-out in a thick cloud
_

Room silent after the door fell shut & resettled
All walls of the building rumbled in giggles

!! PAT
!! PAT
!! PAT

Ben kicked at the stall door braced-shut by legs
'Gonna make your fat-cunt-trap
'Eat that shit you scabby-bitch

Todd stepped out of the stall
'Back off

Ben turned to him more crazed

! YOU

Todd swiftly tackled to the wall
Slamming hard as his soaked-foot slipped-out

Ben muffled as he took-revenge
'You are the reason I got chased

'walk'n around
'like you weren't 
'skipping class

'a teacher notified
'the monitors and got me chased down

Todd maneuvered using Ben's force against him
Set forearms placed Ben in a locked-hold

After several curses & a long pause Ben surrendered

'Alright asshole
'You made your point

Todd pushed Ben off to a safe distance
A toilet flushed and another boy joined the scene in the girls restroom

'Sorry about that
Jordan blushed-out the awkward introduction
'Im sick

He scruffed his unkept thick brown hair into a fluff
His habitual-mechanism to divert attention

Momentarily all content with breathing the compressed-gas in silence
_

Walls washed white layer-after-layer
Extenuated by dark recesses between the tiles
Unable to conceal deep-red marked graffiti symbols

Piss marked all to a feminine territory
If only the stain but mostly the smell

Curiosity here only met horrors
All repelled from investigations

Ben broke the silence
'This place is kinda creepy

Hot-box-gassed-up
No where to go until the class period ended

A sound tickled Todd's ear
An enchanting burr at the tail-ends of the echoes

Before he realized he was interested
Echoes drew him closer to the wall

Todd startled then reaffirmed

'There is a hum
'Sounds like a whimper
'Can you hear it

Jordan put in as he neared
'Probably a god-damned-ghost

He yelled at the trash-can playfully
'School is hella-haunted
'sk-a-dick Bettsy burns-the-dick

'back in the 50s ...
Jordan started his story

Hum came from the metal-box next to the trashcan
Rust smeared as Todd opened the lid for better acoustics
Vent dropped to darkness

Todd spoke into the vent
'We can hear you

( need help help please help )

The sound came softened from great distance
In a fullness-of-scream that rips apart throat-lining

Communication faint
Todd looked to the others for confirmation

( help us    please )

Jordan ventured between Todd & at the vent yelled
'Here
'we are here

'Where are you

( can you hear me  hello please help )

Jordan continued
'We hear you
'We will get the Principal

!!! nnnneeeeeeehhhhhhoooooooooooo

Shriek took all three back in a tight terror
Pitch-to-curl-ear-hairs in absolute revolution

Todd opened the lid with both his hands to shout down

'Who ever you are
'Where ever you are
'We will find you
'That is a promise

Todd left immediately, others followed dazed
To them it seemed a reckless commitment

At 10-min-to-the-bell the hall is at its most empty
Policy prohibits anyone out-in-the-hall

Trio made their way without obstruction
All Monitors back in their lounge on the couch

Todd led them confidently down lower floors

'I discovered a secret passage behind a door
'When I got lost my first-year fire-drill

'All year I been trying to work myself
'Up to this before graduation

'No chance ever came
'So today I promised
'Id make it happen

Todd only-one-he-knew who had seen the long-corridor
Despite years he still believed in what he had seen

'Since first-year
'I been planning how explore it

'Today is too much for coincidence
'A secret door will lead us to her
'I am certain

Todd now empowered by rambunctious company
Three boys followed the stairwells down
A small pack not-to-be-fucked-with

On-the-move breaking all violations
All-in since they left the girls

Todd continued as they rossed lengths of halls of the first year students
'When I got lost

'I felt someone calling out to me by-name
'I followed
'Tho less-than-a-handful knew my name

'I found a door at the end of the hall
'It was unlocked
'At first I only peaked in out of curiosity
'Hard to say no to exploring with a rep like Discrol

Jordan jumped in
'Trust me you dont know most of it
'One story 

Todd annoyed kept on his same train of thought
'But at the back of the closet
'A light-source instead of shadow

Jordan perked in interest
He let Todd continue without offense

'I had time to wander so I entered
'I discovered a long corridor

'The path went ahead for a long time
'It ended at a black hole in a wall

'I am sure it leads down
'But I forced myself to go back
'Before I got near enough to know

'Goddam-creepy-place

Todd looked ahead determined
Pent-up-forces now unleashed propelled him forward unstoppable

Thru the hall towards the basement
Moving around windows
One-at-a-time ninja-like till they got near gym-lockers

Jordan expounded
Stirred with the brisk walk

'Shit-man
'Most my papers for school
'Were all about school history
'Lame-as-fk-mate 

'Yo tho 
'One caught me like

!daymn

'At Downtoan-Library
'People all WTF
'You shoulda been there
~classic

'But the article caught me unexpected
'Bored, but try'n to look like
'I wasn't only there for the roof

'Im thumb'n thru all these papers from the start
'Research'n the first instance Driscol got famous

'This floor is the only basement
'Right so with that-in-mind

'This article
~blow-your-mind-man

'A boy found pieced-up
'In a fishy cult ritual

'Im like some lil muthrfkr
'Put this pulp in tryna-act-smart

!daymn
'Newspaper
~solid-legit

'The article said the janitor
'Alerted authorities from across the county
'They almost hung-up on him as nutt-case

'But then they heard him
~get-eaten-da-hell-alive

'Fleshy sounds & munching
'Huge masses of people chanting

'Man screaming 
'Kept alive past possible

'PoPo from all over the county stormed the place

'That shit all happened 
'according to multiple statements in the newspaper
~on-muthrfkn-second-basement-floor

'First I took it considered Uni Hospital first-floor
'But then I remember from a previous research paper 
'This building only had two floors 
'Over ten years later the Uni built over the school

'I tried to correspond
'But nah nothing man

'We are talking total-silence 
'Newspapers for the entire month
'All gone missing

~she-he-it-son 
'Archive a national data-bank

'Only a physical copy I was holding
'So I stole that shit & now its framed
'One day might be worth fat-wads

Ben nodded legit-approval
_

Each panting hard after traverseing three-floors
Nervousness strained fibers of the soul

Driscol topped global abduction statistics
Prisions less locked-down than the students of this school

Silence for a time broken
Ben countered at the steamroll-logic

'I been here all 3 years 

'If there were multi-basement-levels
'There would be some proof

'A reworked stairwell
'Modified to only move up

'I been on both sides
'The main-wells

'They as old as Miss Finely

Jordan added revrently 
~may-the-cunt-bitch-rest-in-peices

Ben kept speaking

'With three basements structural-columns
'Cant be erased-off-no-mark

~fk-more-so

'All second-floor ceilings are mangled-patchwork
'From the Uni construction

Ben accentuated with a pointed finger

'Uni had way more money & that job still crap

'You both believe that a stairwell could just disappear
'These stairwells created by god on the 8th-day for fks-sake
_

A closet door tucked to the exterior-wall at the far-end 
Past the last classrooms isolated 

Todd approached the door window
All transpired as domino-effect of past choices

Small window exposed a narrow janitor closet
Todd's sweaty palms slid on the locked knob

Light kept on
Exposed a definite century-old-wall to the beack of the closet

Despite countless proofs human-heart only ever ready to doubt
More confirm all-else besides what his experience told him
All momentum fell flat on its face as mis-step 

Jordan knelt in front and took off his pack
~got-dat

Jordan retrieved a pouch and door open
Pack back on Jordan's back before the other two could follow the action

Jordan not dismayed by Todd forelorn-face-of-loss
After two quick-movements the back-wall of the closet opened-inwards

Jordan chuckled pointingto the round scars on the floor that traced the swing of a door

'Todd you shoulda seent yer face yo


Narrow-corridor revealed to turn down a very-long-hallway
Corridor followed the exterior wall of the building

Single-file on eerie currents of certain course 
Irreversible alterations defined life
Endorphins flowed in bounty of oft-asked-questions

Ben admitted
'This is the real outer wall

'I always thought it odd
'There no small windows
'In any of the rooms in the basement


'The Fire Marshall
'Got the school on fire-code

'Rather than expose this wall
'They built that new northside-stairwell

'Whole week the Firemen escorted people up to Uni 
_

Walls made of pilgrim-brick
Large, thick & dark-purple

Brickwork technique lost
Pilgrim-bricks most now all sold-off or stolen
A marvel-of-it surrounded them in bare tunnel

No back doors to any classrooms 
Only to continue long-passage after long-passage
_

End came up abruptly as a blank wall

Todd went busily to search for the door from his memory

Ben chirpped

'The architect must have been a comedian

Jordan countered

'Or hide access
'To an entire level in a closet

'Pilgrims times
'The bay too huge to defend

'Before all them well-to-do-fk-you-fucks
'Bought up all bayside lands

'Back pirate times 
'Bay a scary place to be

'Everyone with guns & knives
~sure-as-shit-sticks 

'Pirates raided every year
'Roy Miller Path
'Arcs right with this school at its head
'As far as any raider ever went
'Often to kidnapped kids

'Thats why we have the motto
'Once a Buc
'Always a Fk

Ben thought he knew school history
He only vaguely heard people talk of what Jordan said

Ben noticed on the old bricks
Symbols carved in peculiar diagrams
Sprawl of it typical of graffiti

Todd busy searching for the door
Finally his nails scraped along a fine-line 

Jordan moved him out of the way 
He went at it with a thin steel-bar

Ben jolted

'How do you manage to get that thru entry-clearance

Jordan's eyes lit in a smirk
He put he bar to Ben's face to inspect the lines & numbers

Ben replied only half convinced
'Security really believes you use it as a ruler

Jordan laughed
'Its more believable in its bag next to my pencils & calculators

Peeled-paint revealed a metal door
2ft above-the-ground 3ft high-and-wide

Jordan turned to them for-real

~she-he-it-mug

'We get caught back here
'Gonna be us screaming

Jordan gave the truth in a stare

'Think some rag-hoe
'Next period hearing our screams
'Gonna do the same for us

'Best-recognize

'Might as well go all-in
'Right from the start

Jordan patted his bar on palm confidently

Todd took the bar from Jordan

'Maybe I should hold onto it

Jordan only looked at his hands
He felt betrayed by them 
So swift & sure Todd's action

Jordan raised an eyebrow
Content to let Todd do the rest of the work

They all helped pry the hinges into creaked-submission

Todd always knew this went down
Now he saw into the black depths

The door had the lock from the inside
It fell down the shaft in distant bangs for a long, long time

Jordan let out down the shaft

'Pilgrims paranoid muthrfkrs

Ben behind spoke at Jordan

'Wouldn't you be

Jordan smirked back

'be? 

'Im worse

'My locks may bend
'But they never break

Ben didn't know how to place the remark
Unsure if Jordan full of the shit his slang promised
_

Dark musty air flowed immediately to them & up
Strong-as-a-gulf-breeze
Hot as furnace vent

Something caught Todd's eye
He poked at it with the bar

Elevator-cords hung mid hidden by darkness

'If there are 3 basements
'Then there are only two floors to explore

An exchange of glances agreed compliance

Jordan looked casual
Ben would not back down

Todd reached with extended-arm and grasped the cord
'Reach out with both hands
'& Commit

Todd let himself be drawn into the darkness
He left them with a confident smirk
He prepared for this

Todd fell to the deep
In an unstoppable-slide

!!! HAILMARYFULLOFGRACE
_

All dark
Distance only abstract 

Movement only testified by the-burning-of-his-palms
Sweat-sprung as will-fought-for-life

To grasp a frictionless cord as skin yeilded to muscles

Todd ventured his legs out
He managed to stop himself into near splits

Thank-the-Father
He did morning-prayers today

Other two screamed frantically down

!!! TODD

Todd looked up
Door only a small smudge of silver in a infinity of dark space


'Im okay
'Im okay

'There is oil on the cords
'I should have expected it

'Gonna take off my shirt
'Use it to hold wrap around my hands for grip

Ben asked without idea on how to back up the offer

'Do you need help up

Todd fearless began to climb at a controlled rate

'Its best only one person
'Be on the cord at the same time

'Im gonna try
'To find a door
'To get to one of the floors

'I fell pretty far
'So Im guess'n up

Cool protection of the shirt
Skin-peel-palms grateful-past-pain

Best course to climb up slowly
To ensure he could get back up

Todd felt for the door with this feet
He spat out iron-tainted saliva

'Old oil

The slide down cleared off most the oil
His covered-hands now had clean purchase

Only sounds of his labored breath & swells-of-air
Gusts came intense, rising in heat from deep-darkness

Todd felt a gust on his stomach
It hit sideways & cool

He stomped out the outline of the door

! TWANG
! TWANG

A beam bore into the darkness

'I think

! I found it

One hand felt for a handle
Door the cold of metal 

!! POMP
!! POMP

Todd stomped the corner down
He pulled himself higher
Kicking-down until the door gave way

He pulled himself into the dusty grey hallway
At the end of a long corridor

'Im off the cords
'Come down

'Wrap your shirt around your hands
'I will be here to grab you if you need it

Jordan challenged

'Best just stay back
'Something get loose and fall
'Right into your face

Ben & Jordan followed down & swiftly entered

Ben, last, climbed inside scraping his knee
Looking up saw Todd & shrieked back falling-on-his-ass

! FUCK

Todd covered in dust-caked-dark-blood-mud
Blood not oil had been on the cords

Smears left where Todd had touched himself
Jordan hadn't taken much notice of it
_

Silver of the dust repeated available light

Forward in a cautious manner of adventure
Level an abandoned fully-equipped-hospital 
All lay as if unexpectedly sealed off

Electricity still flowed on this floor
Emergency-signs gave enough light for them to move secure

Jordan spoke in a whisper

'move & stay
'think first

Jordan in front with hand up for them to stop
He crouched down & motioned the other two low

'look at the ground
'each movement leaves time-stamped direction

Both caught in admiration of their newfound companion
Jordan broght them to a crossroads of halls next to a room

'look close 
'each hall & the room

Jordan's finger traced out-lines of different levels of dust-layers
Careful to keep to his rule to not make extraneous movements

'I cant tell the exact days
'Only the relative difference in traffic 

'this is the main hall
'the path has thinned down 
'compared to the hall there we came from

'compare it to inside the room
'No traffic goes there

'this is how we can know where to go

Inside a room an overturnt bed
A familiar form lay half-sprawled

Ben entered to draw down a corner of dust-layered blanket

A husked-corpse exposed what left of a face
Sweet smells stung their noses

! twang

Ben recoiled back flipping a metalic bedpan
Kicked-up cloud of long-since dried-up urine & fecal matter

All froze to the simple horror 
Death the expectation of failure

Ben's face captured shame & apology

! bap
! bap bap

Main hall echoed meaty wacks
Each nearly shit-themselves

! aaaahhrrrrr
! eeekkkaahhggggggggggggg

Distant defiant cry gurggled into silence
Jordan herded them into the room

Each took a corner of the blanket they lifted 
Thick-settled-dust of the blanket flung over their tracks partially-covering the treads from the shaft
_

Boys huddled in the room
Corpse for company

Green of the blanket stained silver by the dust
Respectfully laid back over the dead-body

Day had long-since numbed their nostrils
Sweet-smell now lost

After time passed Todd braved a whisper 

'Shaft went past the length of two floors

A question which none could answer

'Uni dumps the body-parts thru it to where?
'That explanation doesnt make much sense

Jordan spoke 

'Not much sense
'To have a hospital as a secret basement

'A-mid-evil sex-dungeon
~where-bad-kids-get-krumpus

'That would ease my sanity

'This obviously abandoned
'While in full-service

Todd whispered

'Doesnt make sense
'Water 
'Electricity

! snap

Ben lurched at the obvious fact he overlooked
He took off his pack & repursposed the blanket as tent

Plugged into power
Plugged into network

Jordan & Todd both third-wheel
Put on edge by Ben's rapid-fire-keystrokes

Risk-of-them-all-weighed-in-&-merited-by-one
Curse-the-free-will-of-others

Corpse stared back at them
Hair over-grown long as womans but sex lost to time

Jaw dangled stoopidly
Hollow eyes held a truth
Mystery to present company

Someone was trapped & beaten in the concealed sub-basement of the school
Authorities no-doubt do likewise to the trio of boys

The three boys huddled in a room on an abandoned-level, layers from escape
An elevator shaft the only known exit

Jordan an expert in these situations
Mousecraft
Sure ways only to go about these things

Patience & long-waiting
Until absolute vacancy established

Period-bells could still be faintly-heard
They waited for an entire period

Silence a time for meditation
Accept this drastic turn of Friday morn

Ready to decide upon actions with dire-consequences
_

Eyes & senses well-accustomed they proceeded to the main hall

Halls mirrored the logical-structure of school above
Main hall circled, outside & inner arrays-of-rooms

All watched for signs of frequented areas 
The fresh treads were not man-made

Jordan led them to a path taken daily

One head-of-the-path led to a stairwell
They followed the other direction towards a double-doored-room

Path to the entrance fresh

Todd & Ben hung back as Jordan looked thru a crack
Confirming no movement he motioned the others to follow

Stairs descended into a deep arena
Workstations arrayed each segment of stratus

Industrial-lamps draped over each stone table
Embedded shiny-rungs glinted the steel of restraint ports

Under each table
Various shelves for various instruments

Jordan's heart fainted

'All the tools
'In all these stations
'Down all the rows
'Polished from recent-use

Fresh paths led to a table at center-stage
Only table with its light on

A nude-red-headed-girl bound illuminated
Strapped to the table by a broad-leather-belt

So bruised her face
Impossible to see her freckles

Freckles covered her entire body
Freckled to the point 
Tho bloody, bruised & nude
Freckles the first characteristic noticed
Infinite constellations of cherry-colored-dots

Stitch-patch-closures covered her torso 
Patches appeared in similar fashion all over her body

Her shut-eyes sprang into maniacal-alertness
Two large yellow-orbs lit by fierce-fire

Three boys, not monsters, stood over her

Jordan immediately busy but unable to free any strap

'How do we get these loose

After no response yet exhausted of ideas
Confused past-exasperated he spoke to her square-on

'How
!daFKget
'These god-damn-straps-off

Idiotically loud 

Boys behind him idle & timid to horror intertwined with hormones

Jordan tilted hard
Girl who screamed earlier
Now won't speak to save her ass & theirs

She opened her mouth in wide-display
A mutilated-stump-of-a-tongue-in-a-wag

Stump freshly seared & gleamed with odd-gooish-sealant

A small muffled voice came to fullness

'Finally sorry
'I could not speak

'Hardly-breathe
'When she lays like that

The voice became more clear yet kept small

! Jewels

'Dont move like that neanderthal
'I need to get ready to introduce us

'A hundred years will teach you patience bitch
'You think I dont know what you are doing

Infantile hands forced its way out of a tangle of hair
A creature emerged from her shoulder

A shrunken-head emerged with drawn-back-smile
Two baby-arms attached under shriveled-ears curtsied
_

Trio aghast
A monster perched on the girl's shoulder

The little head replied indignant

'Yes this is a shock
'I understand ignorance

Jewels cast her face-to-the-side-ashamed
Nude & openly disfigured took over her predicament as most-painful

The little head made a-small-exasperated-sound

'How are you such a cunt all the time
'You expect these twirps to keep their shit
'With you crying about yours

! hhhmmmmp

'I can find you a new-tongue
'A longer one if you are into-that

'You had much worse
'Now no need to disrespect me

It turned to another bow & the little head tilted

'Miss the Countess


Jordan leant in between the two

~for-fks-sake
! we-gotta-skat-outta-here

The creature paused dancing a rod idly in the air

'The bands are one leather belt

'Hurry up

'There is not a second to spare

'Above our head you can release it

'Come on rodents
'Not a moment to lose 

'Jewels can't speak now
'& I can't read her mind

'But I can sense what she is feeling

'She feels ashamed of me right now

The puppeted-head trailed on

Jordan found the clasp to be odd-shaped
Only after ingenuity the leather-band released
Only with the help of the metal bar & 6 arms

Jordan's shirt the least dirty
Jewels wore it as a small dress

Miss had them make a measurement & a cut
Foremost to tailor the shirt for her-form

Demeanor of Miss had an instant way to blind the truth
Interacting with her as to-an-adult

Ben's shoes didn't fit Jewels only his socks

Miss rapped Ben as he knelt to re-lace the shoes
Rod extended to a painful twang resonated in his skull

'We need to hurry
'If they come back soon
'Each one of us will be strapped again
'All the worse for let

Promptly they made exodus out the devilish auditorium

Lght had a cruel elderly-tint-of-aged-desperation
Rays followed them in a-haunting-fashion as-if-pointing-direction
Vengeful what themselves had accepted must be fated-true unto-all
_

Elevator cord now clean enough to allow them quick-access back up to the basement
Not till they reached the closet door did they recognize their predicament

Todd smeared all over in blood
Thin-streams ran down his face like bloody-tears

Jordan shirtless
His odd-shaped-belly buldged-out

Ben caked in dust

And finally there Jewels

Ben admitted despair

~how-in-hell
'We going to get out of school
'They are going to know where we have been immediately

'Put us back down here at all costs

Jordan wailed back
~yeah-it
'They will just say
'It another god-damn-drill

'Shit happens like every couple months

Todd opened the closet door & walked into the school hall

'I have a plan

Five freakish forms moved together
Obvious & trapped in the basement of a locked-down-school

Todd had a pre-planned route of exit

Dusty
Shirtless
Pantless
Bloody

They broke into the hall cast from horror
Sharply outlined to a monotony-of-normal-scenes
View more contrast by their outlandish forms

At the end of the hall a teacher stopped her lecture
She opened the door and yelled

!!! MONITOR
!!! MONITOR SECTION 7

!!! 459

The call for any who heard to plaster against hall-windows
Only a limited section for viewing

A mosh-pit of greedy-kids starved for 1st-hand-account 
Marinated in day-dreams from revels of the earlier shit-show

Several girls touted the hideous state of the infamous toliet
Some kid Ben had obliterated 

Main attraction like a relic in a church
Girls recounted their impression always to curious gatherings of students

Up on lunch-meal-meds now in a riot
Each young-heart feral

Phantasms spectated only by larger-classmates
Teachers in this way barred from executing proper protocol 
_

Todd led them around the corner to rush up the stairwell

Two large Monitors stood as sentinels
Locked-down-in-protocol at the main-exit

!!! MONITORS
!!! SECTION 1

!!! 459

Both voices boomed

Todd already passed the hall turnt leading them across the level to stairwells
Movement looked like Todd's plan failed to the other four
Yet the aura told a confidence never-the-less relied on whole-heartily 

There no time to explain
Only for Todd to choose and the rest to follow
_

Cross the school in this method
All Monitors drawn to the wrong location

Their exit higher-up school-levels
Not at the ground-floor as expected
_

Every window filled
Every door blocked

Curious-children stirred by shouts
Starved-sights of spectation
Charged by an eventful-day

Teachers more scared of the fight-pits
Than to do their duty

This factor allowed the five to reach the second-floor unhindered
_

Jordan pulled out his metal-bar
'Now is the reckoning
'Suggest yall wake-up likewise

They passed the restroom of the morn
Towards the window at the end of the hall

Todd took out a key from his pocket
He unlocked the window

'Just do what I do
'Go where I go

Each climbed outside onto a narrow ledge

Sun shone hotly burned hotter their exhaustion

Four-odd-bodies outside on the second-story
World outside too-busy-with-the-day to notice

Ledge continued to an adjacent roof
They crossed over to a high-branched tree

Branch overhung onto the roof in an entangled attachment

By those means they climbed down to ground-level
At the back of the school
_

Onward into alleys towards less-traveled roads

Each of the boys knew how to pass-this-area without-being-seen
They ran tired but now on their-turf

Familiar with what fences led where
Up which buildings to what

Rat-true

Jewels only had a large shirt & Ben's sweaty socks
Ben carried her piggy back the intervals he could

Headed by Jordan, the other two at her side
This kept her mostly covered

Large-city-bustlers continued their way without heed
Four moved as a pack following Jordan's lead
_

They arrived at the edge of Downtown
Outskirts to the industrial-sector

Jordan turned them into an alley
& Thru a hole in a chain-linked-fence he loosed then bound back

They quickly entered thru an unlocked-window
Edifice as dusty as the sub-basement

Each cautiously followed Jordan's movements
Hopping from board-to-board
Trace with few tracks
Up the stairs to a room

Office building once a newspaper printery
Newspapers stacked in dusty-heaps

Jordan locked the room with a chain after they entered
He then pushed away a cabinet to reveal another chain-locked door

'This far from anyone
'Gotta be triple-sure
'So as to sleep

'Break thru one of these
'Loud enough to wake whatever sleep
_

An outside window exposed the endless ocean
Dust free & ocean breeze

Cardboard tatmi layered the neat floor

Jordan led them thru the outside window
The fire-escape was covered by patched-tarps

Floor a netted-metal
An escape rope coiled to a corner

Jordan pointed up

'Got a tank of rain water

'Open the spout
'& Close it with this knob

Jordan motioned them to turn around

'Aint clear-water
'But cleaner than you

He took a brisk wash in water heated-by-the-sun
Water splashed far below

Jewels & Miss to theirself
Front the window content with the bayside view

Endless ocean to the right
Left held the iconic skyline

Fresh air taken into grateful lungs
Peace long-lost now found in abundance
_

Ben asked Jordan
While waiting for Todd to finish

'So what is this place


Jordan looked-down as his face blushed
Laid out on the stitched-cardboard-mat 

'This is one of the places I live
_

All laid on layers of cardboard-stitched japanese-tatami
Refreshed & completely exhausted

Ocean gusts massaged their tense skin
All slept passed-out-till-next-morn

In safe slumbers
Soothed by the-sound-of-steady-waves
_

They all woke in the daze of a new life
Jordan fed them dried fruit & granola
Washed down with Mtn-Dew

'Got locations like this
'City wide

'I can go any where
'And find myself alright in an hour

'Tho this one is the nicest
'Each has a stash of all I need

Jordan closed the container & stashed the food-box in the closet

'Last week I got stuck across town
'Food there must have went bad
'So exhausted I cant remember eating

Jordan finished looking apologetically at Ben
All mostly forgotten by the day

!fk

Ben realized his predicament with this father
His father sure-cocked with a self-righteous beating

Saturday-morn from Friday-morn
Till now the trance finally woken

Jordan had a rummage-of-clothes raided from the downtown charity

Jewels head-to-toe with garments that mostly fit
She had hiking-sandals with wool stockings
Light-blue summer-dress only-a-little-too-short

Her & Miss  tailored the outfit
Repurposed-stockings for her forearms
Jills very sensitive about her arms

Miss always held a finely-made extendable-umbrella
To bar anyone from seeing what quick-to-hide

Jordan now wore a pocketed vest

Ben took an old-leather-jacket
He tied in a roll under his pack

Todd took a set of wool gloves for his hands
Very raw after his recleaning this morn
_

Jordan trailed their exit
Covering their tracks as they returned to the streets

'Take everything
'I never go to the same place
'In the same week

Ben needed to get to the pay-phone at the lower-district Circle-K

Day warming to be hot
Heat relaxed overworked-muscles
Warmed after a prolonged-stiff-sleep

Ben looked at Todd

'We only have enough for one call
'You mind if I use it

Todd complied

'I am the last-of-the-litter
'My parents wouldn't know if I was gone for a week

Pressing pace of life left Jewels & Miss to be sorted out
_

After 4 rings
Ben tried the oldman next-door

Old voice responded
'Heeh Hello

'Mr. Grinvix this is Ben

After no-response came

'I just wanted to call to ask
'If you see my dad
'Tell him I'm on my way home

Still only silence

'He isn't answer'n the phone

Ben waited awkwardly
Only the sound of heavy breathing

Old man finally spoke

'Your dad is dead boy

'Best get to the authorities
'Have 'em tell ya

Voice sympathetic but immediately hung up

Ben stood silent leaving phone to his ear
Flabbergasted from truth-revealed-lie

His dad would always be there

A jackass who tried hard to keep a light heart

To never-again hit him
Nor give him advice-no-other-could

A man regretful of being a father stuck with a son

Man enough to power thru the hardship
Too-often-than-not himself the cause

Ben physically-worked to come-to-grips
Understandings toppled down
Dazed among rubble

Four in silence left Ben space to wail
_

!!! PLUUPP
!!! PLUPPP

A police car had silently snuck up behind them 
Its lights now bright at their backs

'Alright you juuhhhh

Cop cut short as the pack immediately bolted

He turned & fumbled open the door
Which he preemptively shut

Today not a mood 

'Im gonna bust diaphrams
'fkn-lil-shit-fks

Officer called into his shoulder-piece

'Broc here
'I got a 281 on the Driscol 459
'Update the 459 is now a 499

Cop reversed sirens blaring
Actuator of the law of this land
Empowered by the level 9 code
Perpetrators better dead

Focus-as-predator never dropping target
In that negligence he was fused into Circle-K

An overworked-trucker backed by near a ton of Coca-Colas continued only mis-directed 
Police vehicle gripped in front 

An unstoppable mountain till the back wall of Circle-K 

Flesh crunched in sharp folds of metal
Dorito-chips soaked soggy as in salsa

Cop drowned under a cold-death of Mtn-Dew-Slurpee
_

Todd looked back in relief

Police must have been the result of Ben calling his neighbor
Timing on the cop made sense if dispatched from Downtown-Station

He pathed the pack the back way uptown
City knew their identities & placed to ambush them

Questions caught his throat
Grateful of the many more steps still to take before an answer

Todd led the exhausted group up the hills towards his home 
Ben learnt of his father's death
Krew traced & jumped by a now-dead cop

Ben kept black cloud 
Group kept silence 

If the death of Ben's dad related to yesterday
It would soon be known 

Horizon closer with each step & familiar-landmark
Silence prepares the way with comtemplation

Deep sleep of last night swept away traceless 

Entreched in labor with no timely solution
Acceptance of pain as the-state-of-being

Five-miles drew two-hours time
Under sun unabated by cloudless sky
_

Seagulls squaked 
Enjoyment of the uncomfortable position of beings the gulls envied

Tables turnt to the birds favor
What is toilsome for humans a lesiure birds

World continued careless
Inside cars disconnected from momentary-coordinates
Distracted by the thought of the destination 

Five souls suffering 
Unable to begin to voice the matters-at-hand

Full-capacity with present journey
Up hills looming over the Downtown bay
Favoring sidewalks with more shade

Normal world betrayed as an alien-state
Group so fused in the throes of turmoil
_

Miss broke the silence 
She stood up full height
Set her self a few mintutes then with-drew her umbrella to take stage

'I am Miss
'We have not formly met

'I already know your names
'No need to introduce again

Her finest white gloves covered the baby-hands
Irritated Miss continued

'Tho it would be polite

Communication took time to digest
After the miles of misery
They just continued dumbly

Miss only-by-concious-effort paitent

'I have been attached by operation to Jewels

Miss patted the ginger head with the rod to underline of whom she spoke

'Jewels offered our order
'The Esoteric Order of Dagon

'To introduce Dagon to the unanointed
'Is an oath-breaking death-sentence

Jordan smirked an interruption

'Everyone knows Dagons Eve

Miss visibly irked

'Then explain him in one paragraph

Jordan realized his concept of Dagon as an empty pinata

Miss amused continued 

'But I have the favor of the Seer
'So I may do as I please keeping-oathsworn

On the shoulder of the a sidewalk-less street
Pack crossed to a side walk of an office-complex

Miss able to set down the umbrella to focus more of her energy on explainations

Sure of what were only questions to Todd
Only able to derail the sorrow for a short-time

'Dagon is a cosmic god
'Infathomable & Unsaitable

'Earth is bribed to Dagon 
'As an occult offering 

'A sacrifice of this world
'& All worlds connected by Quantum-Entanglement

'In exchange for the bounty
'Past imaginations which gods bestow

'All Earth will be consumed
'Drained dry as Mars has been

'Blessings of omnipotent-powers-uncalculable 

'Some envision the gift of infinite-life
'Indesuptably to be as god themself

'I am one of those in faith of Dagon
'All worth the exchange of a god's blessing

'Jewels is the daughter of a wealthy family

'To pay the price of a family to join 
'Prime of their seed must be given 

'Truthful this binding an honor not a curse

'I am 400 years old
'But only a year as symbiotic member of Jewels

'As payment into the order 
'Past must live as youth

'Don't be fooled 
'I offer much

'I heal her & repair her
'Myself surgeon centries-in-experience

'I guarntee her life till old age & wise counsel

When Miss traveled to other parts of the body she burrowed
A fleshly-lump the size of a small-ball moved under skin 

Right shoulder her perch 
Baby-arms held the umbrella when not busy describing words
Entire puppet folded-up & tucked into a small hump on Jewels shoulder

'We worship the bowels of Dagon

'In Jewels inserted divine-microbials
'This the digestion of the gods

'When I an old woman we found the asteroid

'Tales of Eastern-Monks who under-tourture
'Guided us to a prophetized mountain-village

'Prophecy built on ancient astrology 
'& Deep-cosmic-mathematics could not compromise
'Nor be halted by mercy for ignorants 

Miss trailed off lost in that last statement

'Decades after mining the asteroid
'Lead to unprecedented discoveries

'Asteroid contained mavervelous gifts 

'Mound-of-Excrement of Dagon 
~holy-be-it-enternally

'Sadly only this small mass of me left
'When the bateria-microbials adjusted 

'Bacteria sentient of the well-being of the host as life-itself

'Jewels is stronger than all you boys combined
'Microbials refine all ingestion & internal-assimilation 

'I myself the first generation to live with prepared-hosts
'Viceroy Countess Miss of the Prime Circle 

'If my name doesn't get you out of a pinch
'At some future point when your life is on the line
~then-imma-whores-wet-nurse
_

They kept to the sidewalks with the most shade & least people
Day burned all pink

Gusts drowned out her voice
Perked-of-interest they walked close together
Miss's voice did not carry

'Jewels owes us much 

'But she is a foolish girl
'Gets youthful emotions 

'Yes Jewels is foolish
'Myself always busy 
'Patch'n up what she self-inflicts

! WACK
Jewels back-handed Miss

Miss mumbled sorrowfully quiet for a time
! PFT

'Well-I-never-in-my-life
~hmp

After a few blocks Miss regained full-compsure

'Tho 
'I am sympathtic 

'To her need to be kept
'From our modular fashions

'Inner-circle ordered her to be pieced
'Into a more sensibly-modified-being

'Operation for this morn 

'Jewels is held by us as a priestess
'Name annointed Jewels by the Seer 
'Who fated her to rise above the most high

'Freckles on her body
'Necessary variables to the deep-cosmic-mathematics

'Trick of it still left to be discovered
'Imprecise how it could settle theorems

'Yet all are certain the variables of the transient-positions of the freckles
'Map coordinates to a universe

'Universe favored to the extreme of quantum-possibilites
'Aligned towards everlasting-happiness

'All lost by Dagon to be remade after the image of their best-self

Jordan braved

'best is relative

What he feared hit him with a twang that sang
Miss even more please detracted the rod into a cane

'Order will seek her out because she is this map 
'This skin even-as-leather will leads us to the universe 

'Freckled-patterns can not be captured 
'The freckles shift & move
'A transient location

She sang a verse

'Eden a rebirth fate
'Quantum Entanglement will require all necessary
'Loved-ones, ancestors, decendants to appear in that garden

Ben braved

'Why work to keep Jewels out of the order

Miss expected such smart over-simplifications

'Fate will bear all to path

'That is my faith 

'Faith impossible for youth to comprehend

Todd defended

'I have faith

Miss chuckled

'Innocence of youth
'Faith is a seed nurtured by decades

'Now shut-the-fk-up

Miss continued her story

'Only by the boon of Dagon
'After this world is consumed 

'Deep-cosmic-mathematics
'Can then be fulfilled thru what functions are impossible now

'Jewels future has such consequence
'If her skin lost to the Order
'It would mean the end of this most-unique possibility

'Which some reveer rightly as a command from god

'Power currents have drawn Jewels
'First to wealth, then to the Order

'Now away from the Order

'Many rather wanted to guard leather
'Than this girl who has such free will

Jewels ginger hair caught the beams of sun
A royal beauty no patchwork could mar
Men cat-called out to her & women envy

Miss continued after they crossed the street

'Only one of our Entangeled-Possibilities needs to reach that destination
'Fate the power which will drag all divergencies to realign perfect-trajectory

'To trust in the power of Fate
'Future to have power to change the past

'The sacrifice of all
'As payment for all to attain
'A more perfect existence

'Our order alone
'Decides for all 
'In solemn manners

Commerical zones now faded to residential streets
Schools, graveyards & empty-lots

Miss stayed herself a while 
Jewels needed to regain strength
Not easy for Miss to talk while Jewels walked 

'The Esoteric Order of Dagon 
'Dates to mankinds earliest history 
'Trends have taken its symbolism to idolitary 

'Fools will be pretensious 

'The Image of Dagon
'Alone necessary 
'To wield unobstructed power 

'Molecules bow to will
'Exerted in presence of an Image

'I myself am a prophetess ordained by the Seer
'The Seer secretly entitled me
'Follow paths by accordance to Jewels

'But the force of the whole-cult 
'Too much to stop

'Someone so imporant must be improved as insurance
'Every day new demands which I alone could not save her

'Jordan woke us that morn 

'Providence gathered all 
'To rescue us out of an unbreachable-system 

'Knights & heroes pale to the deeds 
'Which you have yesterday fulfilled

'It only at the cost
'Of only half a tongue

Miss proclaimed as if it a blessing
Miss odd company to have 

Only thing pleasant
On the long stretch to Todd's house

Sun hot in the hours after noon
Lights on in Todd's house

Todd burst inside heart-in-throat
Eyes readjusting to the different-light

The smell of outside inside the house 

Glass of broken windows shattered under his shoes
Leaves whipped-up under family-portraits

Forms of countless-cats at once made out infesting every shadow

First one then countless embattled-cat-hisses 
Felines sprang into launched-agression

A large Calaco immediately charged Todd 
Heft of it large-muscles-buldging-tense

Todd had two-smarts-on it with a kick & a snatch

Each of his siblings had owned a cat
He pwned these mangey-cunts

10 cats stopped the attack
None of them cared to risk the same demise of their leader

Act duplicated over & over 
Calaco a goolike-mash-upon-the-walls

Fresh pulp of meat arose any kitty salivate
So exquistely-rare the patee 

Despite quelled-up with great fear of the rampage 
Several stopped for a quick-lick

Felines swarmed over something on the maternal bed
Most of the body chewed up but it his mother

Todd began vomiting in the habitual direction of the restroom

Huched-face-first-ass-out across the toilet
Past-prime-pickings now only a gluttonous-feed mass of his father

Todd cleared out his home
Macabre painted in stern-rigtheousness 

Corpses of his parents foamed out of each mutilated orafice
Grey puss foamed over the lines of each scratch

No cat-claw could pierce Todd's thick wool-gloves
_

Neighbors came out to witness the loathesome scene
Guilty & in fear of the boy they all betrayed

None with courage to venture near 
After witnessing the horrendous death of the twins

Two basketball-players on the way home decided to aid the shrieks
They returned to the streets puss-filled choked-dead mid-crawl

Police came to get the bodies off the streets but did not interfere further
_

After the last of the cats, past tears 
Todd left the house bathed in warm guts 

Todd used his might to bust the belly
Legs-to-legs above his head 

Cats in lunacy avoided the same fate
Busy in actions which often condemned them in irony

Thick wool golves perfect for pussy-busting
Raw flesh able to breathe
Yet protected from all-else
_

Cats have 9 lives
But they are their own-worst-enemy

Cats take too long to do anything 
Contemplating calculated actions aun to their demise

10s of bodies litered the rooms 

Jules could not walk fast in sandals
Jordan & Ben decided to give Todd space 

Near 100 disembowled-bodies trailed Todd's direction

Over short distance the cat is quick
Over long distance mankind reigns supreme

Aun to naps the cats put-off-guard 
Awoken too late by the scent of gore dripping off Todd 

Over-fence, thru-yard, along-country-road, over-cemeteries, thru-fields
Until finally rocky bays of ocean 

Rock-to-rock in hops 
Crashing waves below

Cats moved with agility 
But Todd still much faster

Todd climbed up birthed in gore 
Only one entry into a thicket-walled-island

Twisted narrow-tunnel opened up to a vast expanse 

Antiquated farm-equipment
Animals of a rare variety
Fire-pits with altars 

One solitary hut built large as a warehouse 
Loomed in the center

Tatched roof to sustain hurricane winds
Edifice had a lifted concrete-foundation

A large bonfire-pit in the center of the circular lot 

Cat with the first warning-message only-just-returned
As if only to introduce the Reaper 

Todd entered the presence of the Witch 
A mess of steaming-mass
Eyes aflame into a well-set-red-core of vengance 

Crafty & full-of-guile is an old witch
Yet the unexpected blaze of youthful blue-flame froze her dead-heart

Slow is man to be slain bare-handed
_

When the four finally reached dunes
Cats kept clear of the area
Laid outside the thicket in a counless ring
Too-tired from their massive trip to move

Todd off to himself content to a corner 
_

Jewels stomached her way around the witch's hut
Parts of the witch so-scattered-such she prayed it due-to-hungry cats 

Leatherbound tomes laid upon altars under balconys
Each balcony with a bonfire-pit
Great iron-pike stood to hook a cauldron
_

City out for them
No where to go but here

Supply of the Witch enough to last years

Water piped from a resivoir the size of a pond 
Kept lifted & covered
Fed by passing torrents

Firewood came pentiful off ocean drifts
Three weeks went by with even less words between them

Each kept alone to their own interests 
Each front a different fire-pit of countless
_

Jewels absorbed herself learning the ways of the Witch
Ordained now to life's calling

Weeks in the study of the tomes
Prolonged-deduction of the state of each pit

Symbols, parts & bowls, mixtures & brews

Miss created a sheild-like-tome bound by iron 
Four-tomes, two-wide two-tall

Leather-pages made from the thin flesh of the abundant dead cats
_

Jordan spent the time in exploration 

Situation of the island excellent
Built from foundation to be off-the-grid
Preserving certain utilities better than County

Island isolated masked to a scene of like-islands on the coast
Each un-traversable thickets  except for small bays

A worn rock cliff dropped off to mellow-deep-ocean-waters 
One leap exfoliated skin in deep-cleanse

Sea life plentiful & transient
Jordan now satifisfied his ultimate-desire
Self-sustenance upon fresh meat killed by his own hand
_

Ben & Todd in similar circumstance
Understood each other as entirely divergent based upon their reactions

A global power now aimed to get them at any cost
Cat-assassins of wiccan conjury
Ben's dad murdered in an unknown way

The price they had paid for their decisions heavy
_

Miss sung at night

'Song of every bay 
'Existence in seasons

'Day after day

'Today is only
'Just another day

Todd & Ben both well-healed in time
In the careful-ways of slow-healing

Ben powered his laptop at the solar-power-station

Todd kept day-long meditations, prayer, & exercise

Jordan lived in peace as if finally repaid from turbid years 

Jewels shielded with an enshrined Tome

Miss ever diligent to guide & grow Jewels talents into abilities

Driscol permenantly-closed
Five pieced together fact from hear-say around town

5 girls went missing 

One girl rumored to have shit in the same restroom
Shit so terrible the janitors refused to clean it

Other girls all over the age of menstration

An outbreak at the hospital cost the lives of dozens of patients
Rumors of fish monsters 

Consequence of unintentional disaster laid upon Todd heavy
He had tracked the blood he thought was rust & the blood of the elevator cord

Trace that led to the deaths of many innocents

Past month chaos in the city
Under worldwide spotlight & slander 
_

Jewels & the cats kept to each other fondly
Cats avoided Todd at eyesight

Reveering Todd with gifts only as he slept

Dead rats, fish, crabs
& Plenty of money & chains

Todd took to a massive religious-piece
All made in gold large-enough-to-wield
Heft of it a precious-relic

Feline robbers stashed funds daily
Payment for fresh fish Jordan caught & Jewels prepared
All after the manner of the Witch

Jewels learnt all their names
& Kept a ledger for their transactions
_

Lengthy-trip to the city took half a day

Store a feast paid for by the cats 
They stuffed their packs with supplies 

Sacks of food tied to their packs
chocolate twinkies bread peanut-butter cheeses dried-meats pasta
_

Baytowns pull in lost-loiters world-wide

Each soul on drift with the tide
Drawn to far-away spheres

Downtown library sat on the hill 
Homeless hobos just below

Library kept an overgrown field to the back 
Lot left alone as a wild thicket

No-homeless succeeded in making any part of the thicket habitable 
Vegetation a fresh-density even fire could not conquer

Unknown to the city the lot had open-access to city water via an exposed water-line
A river of water from a pipe flowed thru it & continued to town

Fuel a limitless-supply in a limited-area 
Location dense & impassible
_

In a tucked-corner-side-tree
Jordan entered the shadows of the tickets

He lifted a bush-arm to reveal a small path 
He stopped to turn & look at them

Jordan's characteristic move meant something serious

'I really feel sorry for you
'Trust me
'I do

'But keep the bitching down
'There are hobos all around

Crawling, packs-first thru a maze 45 minutes 
Trail looked to be made by a rabbit

Walls too narrow for an adult
Most movements snagged in unseeable ways

Relentlessness if tried true rewarded a scathed-body to an open scene of civility
Canopy overhead a ceiling to bar any beam of light
All bright lit by lampposts which borderd a grassy pathway which led to a small-building
_

All bled

Jordan said to their bewilderment
'I put those thorns in myself

!!! WHAT

~alright-fk-off

'I was much 
'Much bloodier
'Each scaring day
'Than you are now

'Took me 
'All winter & five jackets

'But look at it
~hella-fortress 
'In the middle of Downtown

!daymn

'Love being forced to make the path

'A way too terrible for anyone else
'But the person who knows the end

No one in the mood to buy into-that-reasoning
_

Dim-lights lit the completely-enclosed concrete-path 
Miss admired-always for her cheery-perspectives

Miss pointed her shaft at a metal line

'Above look 
'Foundation of this canopy

'These heavy cords
'Attached to the posts

'All set for the damned Carnival-DesMondes

'If there weren't such 
'Death to the tale I'd call it a-hoot-ta-boot

'Arrogant-migrant-workers disrespected the tropical-storm
'City warned them 

~tsk-tsk

!hmph

'Only-just set-up-just-drunk 
'When the storm struck 

'From different-lands is different-fish 
'As we say

'Torments built into a hurricane 

'Hurricane rearraged this area  
'These cords the only thing left of DesMondes
'No worker nor machinery left afterwards
_

A concrete-path bordered by vegitation & light posts led to a utility shed 

Power & water & network

'Fort Thickets
An intricatly-carved-log branded the lot

Miss continued

'This place forgotten the years which followed Huricane Karma
'I remember having walked by it 

'How years hide their gems

'Two-years after Karma
'Only Univeristy Hospital kept open 

'That is why University Hospital has unparalleled off-the-grid-independence
'It is the host of the entire-regions-network

Ben jolted

'The entire region 
'Networked to the same place

All Ben's route-tracers returned bogus-information which kept me uncertain of certainties
This piece instantly set what he knew right & now he pondered the whole

Jordan explained
Bringing the focus back

'My grandpa worked here 

'On a research-project on our ancestors
'Several photos of my grampa
'Taken a different parts of this place 
'At the time the grass up to the street

'I spoke to a librarian about the place

Jordan pointed to a framed paper on the wall

'Ganked it from the Library

Old schematic the original building plan for the utility shed

'Hardly stealing if its doing the paper a favor
'Better placed framed for me than forgotten forever by a city
_

All took comfort in the utilities & 6 impenetrable walls
The makeshift shower a hose & drain walled off by a tarp

Welcome after the rural lifestyle of salt-water baths
All together in the only room only missing the comfort of fire

Jordan rationed the supplies 
Passage of life ever on serious decisions

Levity & carefree actions never native to Jordan nor Jewels
Now lost entirely to Todd & Ben

Jordan last to sit in the circle

'One night past-midnight
'Stuck on this side of town

'Crackhead-muthrfkrs 
'Everywhere tween here & Industrial

'Cold-front storm hit unexpected
'Rain soaked everywhere without six walls

'Security guard saw me 
'Loitering and maybe crying 

'He called me inside
'Let me stay until his shift ended at 6am

'I ate half of his lunch 
'So cold I drank an entire pot of coffee
'Never could stomach the taste before

'Man I wanted to bathe in the sink so bad
'But that would have freaked-out the guy

Jordan looked to the others
In confirmation the action non-conventional 

'Coffee kept me in good-spirits 
'Snuck out with the building-plan

'I used pure force 
'Couldn't stop the pursuit until I arrived
'Literally

'Rain didn't breach the canopy 
'As long as I tunneled I kept warm

'Rabbits kept the path distinguishable
'Much easier to get thru back-then

'I had to brute-force some parts
'Hell quarter-mile crawling
'Switch-backs & shit 

'Impossible without the schematic 

'I knew the shed still there 
'If only four-posts & a ceiling

'But as you can see it kept good-condition 
'I did some trimming but the lamposts & sidewalk-path kept neat naturally
_

Cabin Fever a bite of polar difference
Four rested on japanese-tatami-cardbord

Electricity filled their time 
Carefree life begs obsession

Ben took a trip with Jules to return with the computer
This place more stable for electronics

Code now set as everpresent network accessible from any computer in the city

Ben enlightened by the occult fundamentals of how the regions network established
Over-time able to find the patterns in the gateways of packet-traffic 

Direct links to network allowed him to forge packet addresses to any endpoint
A large amount of traffic passed thru the Library as bridge to the inner-city
_

Ben hustled on an underground network he help enhance
Able to secure deals-around-town
Rides, chores & groceries

Delievery dropped loot at specific places where rewarded with a map to payment

Deal today consisted of transistors, pop-tars, Mtn-Dew ...
Well-tipped driver offered to throw in an 1/8 of shrooms & marijuana

Ben mistook the slang & accepted 

Ben sent him the location of the payment
'$100 taped at the bottom of a bench at the Selena memorial

Jordan oathed them all to wait for an hour in the bush before entering
One of various imutable-oathsworn-protocols none dared breach

Feline theives financed Ben's assortment of computers
Stable pillars the foundation of a p2p network
 
Constant whir-of-activity greeted him as he opened the door arms-full-of-supplies

Jordan immediately popped up surprised 

~dayyymn-dat-danky
!what-choo-got-der

Bored cabin fever drove them all to sift hungrily at the supplies
Despite an inexhaustive trove of funds, supplies always difficult had

Miss said overlooking the rummage 

'Jewels will like those

Rod perusing thru the items
Flinging items here & there

Ben snaped angrily

'Watch it Miss

Named used as curse matching the tone of bitch
Miss gave it to him & they both went at it

Jewels inspected the bag of shrooms lost curiously 
Branches of marijuana & shrooms on her wooden-bench

Jewels irate she didn't have a new tongue

Miss replied tartly

'Tongues don't just grow-for-the-pickings
'Where am I to get a suitable source & workstation

'A local hobo
'I dont want herpes 
'I get it every-time

Cats everywhere except around Todd
They had their own, quicker, narrower paths to the shed

Jules exchanged with each of the cats 
Pimping new cats nightly each arriving with offerings

Her gifts of friendship
Mixtures of feline perfume 
Jewelry & cat apparel

Cakes to fill with energy
For sex, strength, intelligence
Or skull-fkd-delight

Once-decimated-ranks rapidly grew & grew
Witch focused on control of the cats via orders
Jewels expanded on it with ways to grow mutual interaction
_

Blood is thick with identity
Composition stirred by emotion

Blood magic draws from deep-cosmic-wells 
From which all mankind united as brother

Brew of shrooms & blood-dreched-mint leaves
Miss worked the mix into a pact of blood

Split in unbroken-chants
Chants of each all in circle in turn
Gratitude Respect Admiration Forgiveness

Trance-State-Jewels painted an intricate DIAGRAM
Great symbol encompassed each individual into the whole

'May the blood split
'Bind us five more tightly
'For affinity each to other
'Bond one to another 
'Enriched by bonds of another to another

Legs out connected formed a star
Cauldron laid center-circle boiled over gas stove 

Faggot of rolled marijuana & herbal mixtures
Prepared by the inexpicable mastery of Jewels

Vapor of boiled shrooms
Thick-earthy smoke filled the room

Miss lead their prayer, ended in handsigns
Hot brew now cooled able to indigest

Hours-upons-hours
Moon till noon
 
Movements all-surfing-the-same-wave
In-tune at different positions of the swell

Agony of discomfort
Powered the motion as fuse to weld all as one

Each looked across other in reknewed understanding
Familiar whispers assured strengthened bonds 
_

After the hours of fasting 
Cleansed-via-vomit

They took their always-packed-packs & left Downtown
Long trek thru the rabbit-tunnel passed forgotten

Instead of the left turn towards the Dunes
Jewels lead towards her old school Uptown

Miss began her story
Sure of Jewels purpose

'This school is the one of the famous Duties
'Boot-stomping-bruiser-dikes

After a quick look around at blank faces
Unsure if it drugs or ignorance elaborated

'I am sure you have heard of them
'Movie of them still is famous

~Bristly As English-Boars

'Assigned to troll at Ray High 
'The two marched around so loud
'Impossible to take them seriously

'I knew the two personaly
'Eager to use the material of our encounters
'As material of jest to lead my social groups into laughter
'Which karma hit me back as I proved long-the-fool which is yet to be forgotten

'After decades passed the women finally put to the test
'An abductor, of no small size, took a girl 
'She screamed & screamed over his shoulder 
'Jughead sure in his strength as stoopid

Ben interrupted

'Yeah I've seen the end 
'Faces of Death covers the last-leathal-10-min-of-the-brawl

'I thought one of the sisters died

Miss hooted 
'Disfigured but then again who can tell
'The Twins never were pretty

'Man got it ugly
'Jughead all mush after the elder-sis curb-stomped-his-jaw
'Mashed his brains out his mouth

In the shade of large buildings
School now came into view down the street

'Corpus held the record for highest kidnaps in the world
'For centuries

'Since that incident the city never held a place at even the national list

All now infront of the entrance to the school

'Old age has its toll
'3:30 - 3:45

'Neither can keep their eyes open
'Lure of sweet rest into blissful wakefulness

'We have five minutes 
'Be quick

'If you see two woman coming at you
'Drop the bikes & run

Three boys blindsided in paniced-confusion

! WHAT

Miss irritated shot under her breath

'We came here to steal bikes
'I didn't have time to explain
'But a warning is all you need

'Pick one fast & quiet
'Or risk a face-stomp

They dove thru the entrance 
Snuck under the booth 
On-que slept the two

Every action worrisome for them 
Jewels stitched & with unseeming passager

City authorities on the alert 
This venture had to pull off smooth

Stressed persperation bloomed from their palms
_

Lot of bikes open for choosing  
Unchained due to confidence in the Duties
Whom knew the owner of each bike

A selection unparalleled by any shop
big small large neon pimp rusty caged

Several bikes front on gold-painted rack
All other bikes allowed respectful space

Jules immediately lifted the foremost-bike on her off-shoulder 
She held the pedal with her hand

Miss chripped

'We are ready 
'Hurry hurry rats

Her bike a tricked-to-shit-bmx 

Todd took a practical road-bike after a measurement-mount
Sturdy after a decade of use

Ben hoisted up a rugged mountain-bike
Its puffy tires had a relentless attitude

Jordan sweating under his load

! are-you-shitting 
Four burst in unison

Pimped-out bike ostentacious

Present no place to debate
They swiftly headed out

Following Jewel's hand motions
Silent directions to keep the bikes from making noise

Unobstructed back out on the streets within 5 minutes

After the corner turn they shouted & hooted
High-speed down-hill top-speed

Four bikes bullied lanes
Blasting out onto the coastline

Jordan on a lowrider bike 
All set in chrome
Pimped-with-gadgets-lights 
Kicked-back-position drew his left lip in cool-smirk
His pack bound to top of the front tire to balance load

Finally off the high from the brew back rested bayside 
Front bonfire under night-sky at the Dunes
_

Able to act free
All attention to the moment

Each lost & gained much worth longlasting-contemplation 

Lonely states allow the soul susceptible to higher states of being
Re-enforced by need to rebuild rubble of demolished states of being

Jewels never kept from work 
From creation of brews, mixutures, herb-dehydration

Made by hands of craftsmen of dual-minded-expertise
_

All stared at Todd's replication of the DIAGRAM Jewels had drawn

Jewels then replicated it on a virgin part of the dunes at South-Moon
Large stones laid as the outline

DIAGRAM singular in fashion 

Magnetic bonds pulled all tangibly to sit in their placements
Sand shifted to form acute angles in manners to defy science

Miss began

'All are connected by quantum-entanglements
'Kindred spirits which inhabit spheres impossibly-far

'Bond a constant proof of infinity 
'Distance of null impact in quantum functions

'Bonds drawn deeper in interactions of dreams 
'Experiencing lives of others as Passangers

Cloud unblocked the sliver of waning-moon
Air oft-splashed with water-particles sent high by waves

'Dagon

'Echo of AEons       
'Might & truth

'Nations seek to call him forth as a gateway to divine gifts
'Tho all their world stripped upon his arrival

'Distance which seperates the cosmos unfathomable

'Quantum properties testify 
'All realities
'That can pass will pass

'When one given choice possibility-nexi created
'More divergent the possibility the stronger its core

'One creates universes layered over the past
'& Recalculated destiny thru products of action

'Possibility-Severance
'Occurs when two-liknesses diverge to irrevocable-paths
_

'Distance tween cosmos is unbreachable 
'Aun for the Holy Dagon

'Contact thru human spirit consortium a loop-hole exploited to sumon Dagon

'Multitudes empower other a robust network
'Enacted together in massive movements 
'Entangle a reality thru hacks developed over aeons
'More powerful than Magnet, Gravity, or Love

'Entice Schrodinger's Cat to pull Dagon thru 
'In need to satisfy cleanliness of certain warped-entanglements 

'Ancient traditions passed down thru ages of civilizations 
'Led the Order to confirm evidence found on an ancient-asteroid
_

'A rite to directly communicate across realities
'Experience to be shared across universes 
'Cleared of the fog of sleep into alertness of clarity

'This DIAGRAM given to us as a public gate 
'Our private understanding & connection with the symbols 
'A key to illustrate authentic intention 
_

'A ward of protection from dagerous-minds set to lure into traps 
'Possibilities prove
'Always more wise & powerful versions of ourself
'They who know us as we truly are in objective perspective
_

'Each is their own-worst-enemy
'Each in an Order of Ourself

'Symbols associated daily 
'With their emotional attachment
'These are the armor of the soul

'Five of us strong together
'Each as corner for other

'Our rite will be in the position we assumed during the shroom-brew
'We will bind our hands & legs in sleep during these rites 

'By purchase of comfort
'We attain a way to project to other realities
'Casting our mututal connection there in that sphere

'Able to learn on a scale of infinity 
'Which will all confirm singularity in a situation

Position tho uncomfortable laid-natural
Only a nudge dropped them down full-swing

All woke each in a different quantum reality

000000 TODD   000000000000000

All the world under a dome of earth 

Illuminesent-roots dangled dripping light from the roof 
Plants glistened in shining marvels layered soiled-ground
Each uniquely-florescent in mathematical-patterns

A boy swung a giant sword which passed thru all uncontested
Plants burst a cool mushy tastfulness of sticky-goo
Todd sure it an intoxicant

Each bite gorgeous 
Yet none allowed any sense of nutritional fulfillment

Movement hurried but anchored in a pace of endurance  
A steady stubborness carried a hopeless-heart
Defeated yet unable to change course

He stopped to make hand-signs & speak

'My dog

'I need to find my dog
'Voice is passed to you

In any dream prior Todd could never distinguish himself
Now a clear-headed distinction of the presence of two

Boy made an impatient-questioning-gesture
Jordan came to mind

'Dogs
'Dogs logically gravitate 
'Towards high corners in a dome
'Like the one ahead of this gorge

Todd spoke but the words of Jordan

'Echoes will seem to originate from each large-corner 
'Corners will draw the dog naturally 
'Each path you make will leave a trace 

'Your hack-n-slash tunnel will be a simple trail for a dog
'Your scent is carried in all this goo that drips off you

'More corners you check
'More opportunites for the dog
'To come across & catch your scent

Unexpected to a sudden bloom of hope
Joy burst in the boy from the epiphany

As a laugh in a quiet-room
Todd severed from the spurt 

Todd lurched up-ward still-cuffed

000000 BEN    000000000000000

Darkness 
Darkness but a candle

Turnt towards black-walls of glass
Partitioned by of different colors of ASCII text scrolling down 

Hands worked fast over many keyboards 

Keyboards laid all over on massive workbenchs facing the wall
candles memorabilia research-papers code books tea-set 

Lurching around in rolls
Man wheeled him-self about
Automatic-habitual-paths worn into wood floors

clickity clack clak 

Colorful code displayed on various terminals
Each reviewed over & over

Ben could follow and understand some logic
Tho alien-syntax all machine interaction only 1s & 0s

Characters poured down the wall as waterfall  
Each to fill him with satisfaction never-so-deep

Man merely scan or rapid-fire commands
Then immediately push-on to the next station  
Searching for anomolies or confirmation of work done

Ben digested the code & commented passively
Man gave no immediate signs of listening
But at times a slight pause of typing then steered towards Ben's ideas


Man grabbed a well-used box-vaporizor tube on the bench
Ben recongized the smell of marijuana

'Give me guidance 
'I have gone
'As far as I can 

With a swift habitual movements his hands made signs
Thumb connected to last two-fingers
Second & Third up stiff 

sun-pose => fall => inhale-smoke-rise => hand-sign => lower-exhale

Man took a razor to cut a symbol into the workbench
Stood-up & stepped-back proudly at the panorama

Went to the printer to grab a blank sheet of paper
From groggy to possessed in an artwork revealed Jewel's DIAGRAM

Ben's eye jerked open 
Darkened by Todd's-shadow-siting-up
Fire longsince-burnt-out 

000000 JORDAN 000000000000000

Work 
Every second dragged

New customer
Same complaint

New room 
Same mop

In & out 
Dreary-life

Forced as cog in a inescapable system 

Pentance
Guilty of poverty
child-of-the-state

~Believe in yourself
~You can survive alone

~Take heart & leave this all behind
~Your older brother can go to hell
~For stealing your last paycheck

~Boss here is a one-of-a-kind-muthrfkr
~Use your next paycheck towards 
~a pack, bed, tarp, & weapon

~All will work itself naturally

000000 JEWELS 000000000000000

Jewels radiant
Sunrays sparkled off her light-amber-hair

Her eyes emeralds
Her tongue wet 

Bike hopped 
Rail-to-wall-to-flip

Sparks trailed her as she grinded on a bench

Person shouted partly aroused 
There a deep well of sexual desire

He looked down at roadbike-cleats 
Clicking metalically back to the roadbike

00000000000000000000000000000

All awoke together but all felt the exit natural 

Time null
Dimension past traditional lines of perception

Ben redrew the polygon sign the man etched in the work-bench

'This symbol here 

'I want this tattooed across my knuckles
_

Jewels poked with a sunbleached fish-bone
Steadied-by-her-lack-of-empathy-for-pain

Dipped in root of an herb & ink of octopus 
Peppers & other mixtures to accenuate fine-lines

Symbol beautifully portrayed upon Ben's left-fist
Augmented by the artistic-mastery of Miss 

A simple-but-intricate masterpiece
Black-symbols turnt light-brown-red under the sun

Project became an ordeal which never stopped
Symbols expounded from knuckles up the arm
Amplified by patterns of certain-dreams
_

Night prior fumed-rites into sativa induced sleep 
Saturdays dawns on Dunes after a Friday closing-bonfire

Wakeful morn-tides set calm-stages 
Passive scenes for pre-planned actions 

Night lived combustive to a kindled-scene
_

Todd first-every-morn trained
Habitualizing mind & body

Dr. Yang-Jwing-Ming taught him the fundamentals & forms
These forms into shadow-boxing

Others always helpful to spar against
Jewels an endless ladder to improvement

Each had their own style of agression
Jewels a clever brute force all-in push
Tipped an unwillable scale into land-slide

Jordan only ever defensive, while Ben grappled

Ben now had mastered the counter to Todd's technique with a greater vice
Ironic that time in the girls the only loss

Todd point of redemption of a powerful line of monks

Two hours left his body exhausted but his mind awakened
Forced & pushed as if drift-wood over tidal
Prayers, contemplation, mantras, readings, writing

Prayers coupled by yoga poses & martial forms

Western praktice of sacrifice hardened an Eastern-core

Most decisions in life have no bearing to 
good, evil nor neutral

Philosohy & sciences oriented his decisions
Always to gravitate to a larger reason

Thru the use of constant & everpresent themes
Todd praktised artes of instant-divination

Tho moments entirely new & relational
Distict endgames laid out apparent doors

Doors high-lighted by halos in a sea of the infinite

Todd noted all their dealings in a record which he kept without fail 
Jewels a diamond in all this 
Her emitted refractions captured & treasured fueled all-else

Passangers in Mecca to reach him
Bestow upon him their gratitude
Enriched by this impoverished idol
_

Adventure returned them always to the city
Flock migrations in tune with the season

Spot to spot to spot
All knew spot destinations


Logs maintained if-seperated
Logs pinged their locations
Eventual only all rejoined

Each had a pack of their core items
Each location had accumulated stashes

There had over-whelming amount
Where here never-had-enough-of
_

Miss kept on Jewels to grown her own plants

Power of plant-magik
Unlocked thru engeries of service given to the plant

Sexual-pain in orgasm of the pluck
Never to cut them only guide them with cords

Soil not plentiful at the Dunes
Nor the enviornment kind to plants

Gusts kept all vegitation stunted 
Salt dehydrated all to a hardened bark

Massive acres of Texas farmland surround the city
Miss sure of some region to sneak a garden

A hidden cultivation of plants with access to irrigation

Harvest moon waned to orange/redish tints
Forgotten & unused acres
Obvious against cultivated lands only-weeks past harvest
_

Friday nights alotted for long-suffering-adventures

Jewels had nurtured month-old-plants
Each nested on the bikes

Friday night on a long ride to the outskirts
Farm-hands & all related just-paid-well-drunk at bars

15 kilometers to arrive at the border
Yet there required a scour

These plants would find home or die
Roots could not sustain a return journey

Jordan welded a hitch for a one-wheel-trailer 
Pimped-position kept his feet outstresched ahead
Riding low against minimal air-resistance

Agitation on the plants unavoidabley to scar them with a sense of insecurity
Roots would grip peaceful-plains with a steadfastness from the experience 
An end to which so much sacrifice had paid

/////////////////////////
// Across town & down roads past horizons
// Each passing truck honked
// Calling them out as stranger: noticed & remebered

// Holligans up to no good
// Plants probably drugs
/////////////////////////

Hours passed into moonlight

Jewels finally stopped arms out-streched-skyward
Sensing the energy of a wishful-place

Miss affirmed with air-of-pride
Umprella compass to her magnetic-pulls

'Yes 
'Deep-water in the air

'Jewel
'You dear gem
'Your ability is second-to-none

Jordan keen to practical-ingenuities
Bikes stashed inside an overgrown-roadside-drainage

Jordan always covered them with a dark tarp
He locked the set with his handy-chain

'Bikes will stamp-down trails too obvious

'Without the bikes
'If we move careful
'Passerbys won't distinguish the foot-path

Always it was 5 lenghts in the a sharp turn one-step-path

//////////////
// Jewels carried her pepper-plant
// Strand her variation based on the Witch's main-root
// Heavily grafted with modifications

// Peppers kept off parasites
// Peppers helped keep meat
// Leaves produced thick-smoke
//////////////

10 Acres thru single-file
All infested with dark-red-ticks
 
Mosquitos & gnats feasted 
Bugs bit at their salty-sweaty-bodies frenzied

Lust of meal perked all more for worse

A small hill loomed in the horizon 
Leakage off the hill made the path difficult

Mud caked their shoes till ankles
Shins sliced by serrated-leaves

Jordan pointed at rusted-hinges
A gated hill shut for decades 

Overgrown the gate could only be hurdled

Signs of long-abadonment

An old camp chair next to a rusted-thru-tin-bin 
Decades-old-crushed-beer-cans crunched everywhere

Strewn about odds-that-spoke-of-a-person who kept this place as private-quarters 

Miss commented still worn from the journey

'It must have been a miserable-fool 
'To keep this parcel-of-hell a lounge

Jordan said assured of the hill 

'This is definitely manmade

Tho molds of the hill had longsince-become-organic

'Plains-dirt causes this shit-pit

'No cohesion to let the water run smooth

Pack twisted & curved, blazing up overgrowth

Plants thick & greedy for space
Full of things which crawl & bite
Foliage 10-feet-high at places

Path broke to grassy knoll at its summit 
Plateau larger than what-looked-possible-from-below

A dark plane circle lay flush with the ground 

Miss had a habit of annoying them with her poetry

'A dark portal  
'Sacred pillar

'Reflection without ripples 
'Harvest-moon bore mirrored

Each soaked the sweat & tourtures of raw flesh
Little fish nibbled away the crusts of skin & ticks

Miss explained 

'The architect of th Downtown Memorial
'Once described the difficulty of the process 
'To engineer a water-mirror

~proof-of-mastery

'Where his words

'Here is one formed by more than happen-stance 
'Reflection adapts stabalizing to perfect reflection

Wild grass held a lush Kentucky Green, cool & soft 
Blades of it clung as moistured-gauze
Balm on tired, bit & sun-baked-flesh

Two hours past in preparation of the banks 
Four turned the soil with whatever-worked at hand

Removed grass replanted in care
So beautiful the summit vegetation

Jordan retrieved the still-serviceable barbque-pit 
They alloted a section of the bank for the DIAGRAM constructed with washed-pebbles

Miss conducted rites over metals, wood, mineral
Marijuana dashed over the top
Each hovered over the flames chanting after Miss

Faggots incensed to calm nerves of the roots
Happily-high all enjoyed the moment

rite materials as bed to the roots
Plants carefully enlaid upon pool bank

Dawn broke as all positioned at the DIAGRAM
Taken by sleep upon carpet of Kentucky Green

Japanese doors exposed sections of the outside world
Bright noon-sun shone down a forest pond covered by lily flowers 

A giant python lay in the heat of the day on the bank
Cat neck-stretched top a coil of reptilian

Cat came purring-sweetly perked at the arrivals

Curated-gardens of the same plants Jewels transported to the pond
Soil turnt a rich-dark of ground-coffee-beans & shit
_

Large wick candle blazed-crackily at center of the room
Tatami floor left a square cement pit for the candle

A thin-metal-couldron boiled hung-over the candle
Metal worked gold into a unicorn among forest animals

Each crossed-legged
Across other around the couldron

Boys in simple alcoyte clothes 

Jordan looked healthy in shocking distinction from nomal-lumpy
Ben was muscular with a thick black beard but a balding-scalp
Todd a plump chinese adorned by the same relic-cross

Chants crept groggy-concious
Mint perked-attention of the passangers 

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

Words melded to their minds
Unable to capture the words as one grasps smoke

Jewels eyes burst open
! the arrival

'3 long years to summon 
'Many have come & gone
'But only thee we seek

Jewels spoke in firm-beauty
Perked enticingly by the rich-adoration caused by her voice

Prophet adorned by all-fine-things

A tiara laid by fine workmanship 
Fish-bones & pearls worked into gold

She bowed in introduction
Motioning boys to stand

'I am the Prophet of La Gatenau

'Our monk life paid in sacrifice
'To bless infinite-realms

'In life-mission to seek you five

Jordan passed a cone of marijuana wrapped in dry tabacco-leaves
Puff-puff-pass & handsings in synchronized unity

DIAGRAM & response-DIAGRAM
Set all to ease

Eyes closed & linked forearms
Chants continued


'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh

From darkness grew a purple dot
Slowly the dot grew into an orb

Surface of the planet uniform
Megolithic-dust-storms swirled in simple patterns

Jewels annotated

'A simple devastation
'Earth processed into purple dust

'Image a herald to the doom of your reality
'Doom tied to all in a flood of inevitablities 

'Each Earth in turn nullified 
'To prove the singularity that all serve as  meal to the god DAGON 

'Prepare

'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
'whooo ahhh ehhhh ohhhhh ahhh
_

Wakefulness slow
Entrenched in the chant intelligble due to dryness-of-mouth 

Eyes damned by mucus cracked open by tears-of-agony
They drug heavily to the water to soak hours 

Jewels too put-out to set out a healing-vapor
Jordan familiar to miserable situations able to get a tarp laid

All put-out & passed-out on-and-off
Unable to sleep-deep thru present-misery
_

Hunger woke them hours later 
Jewels urged them cautious

Movements in meloncholy for the longing of speech

Instant Jewels woke Miss collapsed of exhaustion
Jewels carefully kneaded her down into her nest

Trance lasted two days & nights
Prophet Jewels dealt them great harm 
To wretch them in suffering-unparallel

~Prepare

A message cost agony
Themselves they experienced as ones-greatest-enemy
_

Moment Miss woke
Miss creaked out

'Dagon will be summoned
'No force can stop
'a gateway built by
'thousands of years

'great minds of the world failed

'pent-up power so great
'the order can only succeed

With no food forced into a laborsome-journey to Jordan's nearest location

Behind a car-lot near a highway 
Old water & dry food to soothe them back to health

Winter-months at the Library
A bitter-time of sunless-days under a moist frozen canopy 
Passive to the paths of constant-northern-gusts & frozen-colder by the ice off canopy

Jewels communicated by unmistakable gestures
~ fK-this-damn-stub


Jewels argued with Miss in cabin-fever
Miss often only rapt Jewels on the head

Hot but stuffy in a one-room-building
Silent in misery

Jordan spoke up

'Lets go back to the Dunes
'Rather have a few bad days
'Than have all shitty ones

'For-fks-sake

'We all synced to mutual-bowel-clockwork 

'Jewels shits 6am
'Todd always at 7:13
'Ben shits after lunch
'I shit before sleep

Ben snapped back annoyed

'I cant pick up & leave

Keystrokes hammered his mood audible

'Code takes time to set up
'Before I can think of walking away

'We might not come back for a months
'Major pillars of the Undernet based here

Todd pointed out simply & reinforced with suspicion

'We been here over a month

'Aren't you always on about how you can get same access anywhere

Ben got up from the computer tilted
Using his hands to help communicate

'Dude I tell you the same things always
'I am refining mechanics

'But to refine the mechanics in code
'I got to take it apart

'Let me rebuild the modules then we go

Ben had gotten back down to begin typing
After ten minutes passed

'A new drop is coming
'Jewels

He turned toward her
Jewels hissed at him

'Trailer for your bike

Her smile melted all cabin-fever
Happy the rest of her day in merriment

A week required to prep the trailer with all required layers of paint
Mandatory before Jewels attached it to her bike

Todd jealous of the master of Ben to diffuse the situation

'Well we do need 
~coffee-n-shit
'I will get the drop

Jordan's phrase word all adopted 

Ben resumed his clacks

'Wanted: 1/8 shrooms & lb whole-bean-coffee & jelly-beans

Ben threw an accusative finger at the tatami-mats

'Jordan built those for streching
'Yall need to be busy doing that

'You might not know 
'How you are supposed to 
~Prepare

'But as for me I got a damn-good-idea
'My entire life is culminating into the Undernet 

'Mankind is going to battle with some God
'We have no knowledge of how to beat it

'As Todd says 

~I have faith this trajection
~Fit some necessary role in the end

Jordan added to the situation

'None of my skills are new
'Far as me 
~Prepare

'Got it
~smack-on-tack

Todd ashamed agreed to the same
His strength meditation & contemplation

~Prepare

A high-priced-message of no personal-value
_

Computer-arrays heated the utility-flat
Six monitors mounted on the wall

10 machines of various shapes
Wires of rainbow-sort intertwined them

Ben controlled all via his laptop

Results a flow of ASCII down monitors
Mezmerized as a cold flame
_

Caffine obnoxiously powerful 
Brew melded into the high
Enlongating life of the trip

6 hours straight Miss convinced them to meditate 
Miss never wrong in these promises

Faggots inhaled & brew passed around
Over large-flame of Jewels hand-made-candle

Miss instructed

'just a tttthhhh

'no hauking please

'i will hang you on a cross
'rapt you head hard on

Streching each other in pulls 
All bound to the circle

Tomorrow skate-day
Skater-krews all over the city skate spot after spot

Jewels tomorrow was going back on the skate-scene
_

Ben took a backseat past weary-exhausted
Drank coffee & blunted-up

Green Bull: coffee & blunted-up

Mechanics of code finnicky & specific
Interfaces must have structural-soundess
Infrastructural network piping industrial-grade

Computer-nodes networked together by homogeneous-unix-kernels
Each tapped into the network on some distributive task

Ben's Undernet launched in desperate soil
A society too long censored

files messages listings 
All projected out in a monolithic P2P cloud 

Regions network-packets only analyzed & routed at central

Unix Undernet easily spoof data-packet in end-to-end end-points
$KEY allowed users, leecher, posts

Each node independent in a lasse-faire
Nodes of most interest had node $KEY of higher value

Ben long-since exhausted 

'Hard to tell when code is mine
'Or not after I type it
'How much credit can I take 

~tsss

Miss stated knitting busily some silk
Speaking around the typically-obnoxious-snores of Jewels

'One enlightens all
'Neural connections associated with understanding
'Natural paths created by mechanical-electrical-piping 
'Quantum Entanglements form all neural-pipingings 

'New connection created an echo out to all entangled 

'To one a connection dormant forever
'To another a deep well of treasure
_

Jordan always went first to break wind
Low to ground with low-wind-resistance

Jewels next along hauled the Tome trailer
A massive chain jingled in a coil aside Tome

Todd next with Ben to follow
Fat tires heavy in a long-haul

Nearby school lots all empty
Skaterless lots on a Friday
Only meant one thing
_

Vacancy meant skaters migrated
Else one or two always be there trick-shit

Ben drenched in sweat & labored approached an old couple walking their dog
Sight of him startled the couple

~hey you seen a bunch of skaters

Old couple only looked back defensively 
Dog in front held in firm protection

Jordan slandered-typically something obscene as they left
_

Eventually it was discovered
Skaters convexed at an all-invited-house-party

Place on the wealthy-side 
A caged tiger roamed the lot

Host took Jewels to present around
Miss asleep in her stomach

Jewels BMX famous since childhood   
Fame a shock to the boys 

Hype of the gathering

'Jewels & the UnderNET kingpin 
?! Are fucking friends ?!

Ben followed Jewels tail 
Sack of USBs passed out

Todd & Jordan both avoided to be the nobody 

Went on their own troll
Hard-core adventurers
rolls, rope, gear

People always talk or prove-up
Most never slept outside a night

Solid-advice from druggies
Weathered in the experiece of horrible situations

'I had to drink water from a toilet
'You use toilet paper to filter

'Did you know you could use toilet-paper as filter
'in a nuke-fallout
_

Masion on the ocean side
Room each unique in its own special-way

Krews from each school present
Ben handed out USB like gold-bars

shots hits motorboats-around-the-house

$KEY of the newest sector accepted as valuable

3am Jewles rounded up Jordan & Todd 
Cleaned up Ben crying-drunk

All trailing their own party of strays
~need-a-place-any-place

Industrial had a window & door ocean-side

Old clothes discarded for different clothes
Blanked & bedded into breakfast

Jordan gave the talk
Each in turn oathed

...blah blah blah
third-party-heresay-result-in-our-death

Four of them left the next day to return with bikes

Krew of 8 could manuever anywhere uncontested

Jordan talked up the Garden
He promised it would be an epic-trip

A large girl named Manda
Two twins named Greg & Steve
Kikochi a Japanese temporary 
_

Kikochi played the flute on Jewels request as they appraoched
Song caught with the breathless sight

A sacred pool in different manners but unmistakable fashions of his heritage

Plants saturated the air in a hum
A great-greenery amassed on the knoll
Polished stones bordered the mirror-pool


Greg asked holding the giant cat

'What does the cat eat while you are gone
'big-ass-bag-of-cat-food
'caz if so you forgot it

Jewels 
~Millions mice in fields
~Many pests feed cat

Cat speaking with Jewels in short-clear-purrs
Walking her thru tended plants of the Garden discussing
_

All soaked in the water
Kikochi struggled to accustomize himself to the fish nibbles

'Creepy

Manda dived under & back up to momentarily obliterate moon's reflection

'Makes me feel more natural
'Two organisms in same enviornment help each-other 
'Not exploiting or molesting

Kikochi pointed to his dick

'What you say

'One earlier bit my penis

Jewels splashed his way 

~Ate tick off dick
~you got favor

Fish food experience too creepy for the twins 
They only euro-bathed

Four felt a calling near
Each in a darkened-dread

Jordan started to lecture

'We are going to be in a state

Greg accepted eager to cut off an unnecessary rant

'Yea we got you guys

'spray your face with water
'dont laugh when you shit-all-over

Jordan blushed, his shit always diahreeah

Miss directed out the large ceremonial-candle-column
Jewels moved it in pain for how long & tedtious the candle took to make

Thin Couldron full of a gallon of herbs & water

Kikochi finished another song
Chi re-aligned-the-mood

0 united 00000000000000000000

Darkness slowly unfolded 
Stillness broke to swirl-motions

Sense of color baby-blue & smell of ocean
Taste of familiar pulls woke them 

Jewels sat top a floating platform
Long sliver hair trailed in currents 

Platform surrounded by mirrors on all sides 
Mirrors enlade by a metal of dark-purple-hue 

Jewels human-upper-form meled to milky-white-scaled-lower-body
False-Dan-Tian Tatooed by DIAGRAM
Below large forest-green-scales transitioned into a pink-scaled-tail

Sunbeams glinted colors off her scales
Her looming over each with her large-orb-eyes slanted-oriental

Perky breasts answered the boys long-since question

Jewels drew in a long-thin-cigar
Fine-dried-leaf & fresh strand
Wrapped in a leaf shell 

'Dagon the dragon
'Coming thru you

Voice cracked unaccustomed to many words
Puffy lips painted a deep-red

'I am Jewels 
'Pearl of Seven Seas

'Aquatic-spirit delves deeper than humanity
'Portion speaks to greater bearths of existence

'You will lose your battle against Dagon
'That impossible to change 

Mermaid-tail waved the water in swishes of calming sounds
Orbs reflected in the mirrors of her eyes

Seven great oculus-pearls rested upon a bed of vegitation
Two pearls cloudy dark

'Be assured
'Many fates await after Arrival

She drew them in with another longated-pull from cigar

'What is learnt of this first encounter 
'Must be transmitted to aid all others 

'Image of Dagon
'A clone entity

'Dagon links an Image in each reality 

'If Dagon killed in one reality
'The god will possess the Image of the previous realm

'Infinity upon infinity in chain-link

'If Image of origination destroyed
'That origination is your reality

'Dagon will be naturally afterwards be sealed-over-time
'Exterminated as possibilities gravitate to the successor

'Lot fated to fail 
'Learn to survive  

All melded as water-drained
Awoke each in front the other
_

Five days had past 

Jewels bowed to the four friends
All kept loyal to duties

~suffering of this time less
~more power for longer time
~more clear the summon

Chili-tea brewed with herbal-leaves
Sustained them quickly to bearable-state
_

Twins rearranged the shed 
All the supplies depleted 

Group managed to produce recipies of what available in the Garden
Jewels & Miss astounded with this discovery able to implement their recipes
_

Symbols now major part of their life
Together set upon a symbol to remeber the moment 
Inscribed on space of body all had vacant

Symbols, flags to awaken sleepy Passangers to alertness 
Anchor to tie-down memory after wake

Mermaid DIAGRAM laden with a crest
Tiara crafted into crest
Crest embroidered in pearl-skirt
_

Morn after long adventure 
Crew under hot sun at the crossroads 

Three boys left back to their homes
Manda stayed grateful to be far from home

Easy coast-hills over dirt bike-trails
Thru some thickets & back to the Dunes

Full moon & initatory dive into ocean
Despite many wails from Manda

Jordan taunted her after she came-back-up

! remember
! undertoes will bring you back 
! eventually

! trick to stay alive that long

Manda responded with hysterics
All had to struggle to rescue her
_

Jewels & Manda took some girl-time
Manda hair too-thick-curly for the sand

They spent long hours molding her dredlocks
Beeswax & oils kept the locks firm

Dreadlocks deeply-cured-hair
Hours endless of labor

Jewels

~fk-the-world
~flip-the-bird

Front bonfire in fast of food

Todd lead them

'Our reality will be destroyed
'Others will likely forsee it

'How do we sync to them

Jordan inturrupted

'Streets will always have symbols
'Like grafiti or flags

Miss added 

'Agreed that is wise
'We must each await this

'Symbol of the Gates
'This the Crest of our Pact

Todd added disappointed

'Join up with a movement
'Rather than start our own

'A humble but necessary route

Ben tossed in

'Our mission is to survive

'Ground-zero will be the most logical safe-zone
'Here we set up a gate to enter & strike the Order

Jewels signed

~Eye-of-the-hurricane 
~Or nuke-city
~I say 50/50

Ben continued

'Image must be secure
'Near the portal will need to be a stable
'To them it would be secure one place

Todd joined

'One area to scout
'Pass info to the realms that will be hit

Ben continued

'Presence on the inside 
'Some world power may be found
'This group to enable us

Miss finalized

'Gate way to the heart the Uni

Miss turnt to Todd

'Will that window work twice

Todd smirked cockily

'I had it checked legit

'When I ran away the first time I found the passage
'I snatched the key random 

Ben ended

'Why go thru years of chanting
'To give out a hopeless warning

'All-ever passed-in-this-existence 
'Consumed as meal for one-being-alone

Jordan looked up

'Nests-hella-infest 
'Always centers a fat-bitch-queen 

'We know the school 
~three-god-forsaken-years

'Who over us 
'best to break-in to the Uni

'Todd you still got the window key

All agreed

Jordan lit up excited

Gaze up in the sky arms-outstreched 
Crying out in circles

! Finally 
! Xena 
! in-arms-soon

Each with  creepy-experience
When they learnt that about Jordan

Manda looked around confused

? Xena

Jewels turned her to herself
~stuffed-giant-panda
~used-for-humping 

Ben filled int 
'left in Jordans locker 

Jewels rode the air giving winks at Jordan

Jordan shot out

'Hey dont steal attention from out moment
'Xena is the perfect companion

The invisible bear threw her down to ride her stallion

Jordan smiled

'Hey our kind has pride
'Xena is only inanimate to those 
'Who don't show her love first

'You know kinda like a cat

Jewels stuck confused at the truth
_

Ben frequently rambled-on as he hacked away on puter
Night-times best for dark-terminals & batteries

'Regional network routed thru University Hospital 
'One key likely existed as a backdoor to all traffic 

'Any pattern would betray itself eventually

'Birthday-coincidence-proof is strong
'Cleverness helps quite a bit


Manda opened an adoration

'Ben global 1337 hacker

'Damn-son kill-it yo

Jordan caught it

'ttttahh
'I never say kill-it

Ben continued

'Todd you never asked me 
'Why I was chased the day we all met

All chewed roasted-pepperoni 
Front of a bonfire waves breaking near-by 

'For more than two years now
'Anytime I was at a computer at school

'I waited for a chance to create a listener

'I created code to work-with other nodes I set up
'Set to link together every morning from 1am-4am

'My first major hack was to get all synced
'To try and find a pattern to make sense of network traffick

'Had several functions of ingenuity to help crack it

Manda hooted 

'pimped-out-bitches-like-hotcakes

A long banter flew up & over the audience
Mandy had tried hard to work on her timing

Ben took it back up

'Each node sent data back & forth in search of patterns
'Looking for the known protocol

'Simple mod over data-sets until data parasable 
'When a computation is parsable
'Each node will send to key to a printer I hid in a closet

'I jacked the printer from an insurance office
'They fked over our car insurance

Manda shook her head at him disapproved

Ben defended

'My dad stole cash
'He was pissed I only took a printer

'Snuck it in with my winter-jacket
'Hide in the jacket-closet of Mrs. Stevens 

'Set it up in the janitors closet under the stairs
'Space unused and a nearby net-cable to splice

'I decided to hide at the end of the day
'Stayed in the room with a few bottles to pee-in & snacks

Manda

! OMFG

Ben continued

'Spliced it into the network 
'Went back to sleep in the gym until PE woke me

'My dad flip-ta-bich-&-slappped-me-good 
'Turned out my plan to get away with it flopped miserably

'I got impatient & after a month I got desperate
'I waited till the Monitors 
'All returned after their trolls

'I was right in the middle of the hall
'When they left to go deal with Todd
'Mr. Dumbass walking around

'Instead they found me

Several cracks were made at Todd's expense

Ben drew them back

'My code should have cracked the key
'If its cracked it will be printed
'Just a grab-n-go

'I have the code written down
'I know there are no errors

Todd reacted

'You mean you have faith

Ben didn't take the bait

'Breaking into Uni
'Is most important

Jordan patted Jewels on the shoulder
All always rightly blamed her for their summons

'Maybe we sell ourselves too short
'Who else in the world
'Could crack that type of access 

'Get the data
'Plant an encrypted-bridge

'All seems prophecy to me

Insomnia the soil of Ben's childhood
Night the time Pops popped-caps

Ben always kept actively moving spots
Pops always managed to find him in time 
No matter how drunk 

Popped-a-skull worse the-longer-it-took
Decision to run crossed-a-line 
Trespass forgotten only after the haze-of-next-afternoon

All rant & abuse until then

~cost of new school shoes
~there kicked aside-disrespectfully

~coulda ate McDonalds 

~not the shit-which for lunch
~preparation cost
~the only two free-minutes of the gawddamnday

Ben avoided the clumsy-lunatic easily now
Clumsy-lunatic Pops favorite state-of-being

Once out of sight jump into a nook
He built lights in various places
Tool-set-flashlight in his pocket
Ben used the time to read

Hiding the only time to read
If Ben caught loungeing on couch 
Pops triggered like an explosion 

Once the wild reasoning

'If you didn't mark it
'There no point 
'Have'n to remember it
'Der dipshit

'If no point 
'Of have'n to remember it

'Then why the fuck 
'Would you read it boy

'We elect you
'Mayor Dipshit

Lecture under-pinned by pain
Pressure-points to be taught

'Yea you hate me 
'Well buddy
'All humans hate their daddo
'So fk it

'Lessons need to be learnt
'Dont mean you get em free

shin kick-sweep
locked-hold-grapple
wrist pressure-point

Acts that would be typical of an older brother
If they weren't always too-over-board

Abused by effect of drunk-tryhard-parenting
Ben had heard of worse reasons to be abused

Despite the weaknesses of his father
Ben looked-up to Pops 

Pops cracked to the core
Stuck as single-parent
Provide all in a hard world
_

Pops stole textbooks from the city library

Learnt Ben up on subtle-arts
Tricks too keen for school

Ben would wait in the car out front
Always on rainy days

Pop's favorite artic-military-coat

'Need a reason to stay hooded-up son 
'Two coats to steal-large
'Remember that one

Wisdom imparted in payment for guilt
Of what remained after hazey memories

Gleaming as a redeemed-man does
Passing down a lesson-for-the-ages
Endorphins-high rewarded by evolution

Returned with two large textbooks of random sort
Displayed like hunted-food for a starving-family

Dad always taking Ben as ingrate

'Listen shithead 
'When you get the balls that drop 
'And the skills like mine

'Only then do you deserve choice 
_

Pops a true muthrfkr 
Type to fk around casual 
Leave a virgin stuck with a babe for 2 years

Courageous enough to return to raise him single-handed when needed
A fact Ben used as pillar to keep the image of his father holy
Pops sober-intention understood now after months of contemplation
_

Ben eventually took up the tricks of his father
He accumulated a trove of out-of-date-unix-books 

~To lift up the shell
~To hear the C

Kerigan & Ritchie & Richard-Stevens 
Homogeneous kernel of unix networks
_

Pops once presented Ben a USB
As payment for listening a life-lesson-lecture

'Shit you never know
'When hell gets real

'Cops bust in

~oink ~oink

'They search evidence

'& Where is the USB
'Full of all the evidence?

'Out the puter
'Down your throat
'Before any seent you

Pops showed off the trick with a grin
Ben took it & proved the move

'All incriminating-evidence 
'In your shit at county

Dad down-to-earth genius which he wore too-proudly
_

Each year Pops needed less & less alcohol
To trigger into his habitual state

Reading a sensitive subject to trigger
Ben caught with a book in one of Pops moods

'Learnt is fine & well 

He slurred & slapped 


'But boy tell-you-me 
'no MAn a choose 

'bull-onie-bull-shit
'over real-life-skills

Kick Ben out of the room
Kick the book to the floor

'piss on books
'only fools follow

Laughing maniacally as if front audience
Ben with a mess cleant up quick-the-better

His personal library distorted piss-stained books
Highlights & notes distorted kept him re-writing & marking

//////////////////////////////////////////////
_

Pop phrases always popped back into Ben's mind
'----like fkn cop'
'----like your bitch ma'
'----like ....'
_

Six together around the large pit
Life taken in seriousness requires fast

Ben accidentally interrupting the silence
Then said fk-it-to-continue-rant

'lets see anyone else 

'takeover a whole region's traffic
'fknmuthrfkr

Manda sighed out

'thank-god someone spoke

Jewels gave props

Miss took the rebellion steamed

~Prepare

Manda encouraged by Jewels burst into a rawl of her own laughter
Mood evaporated without trace

'Oh right wit you gurl

'Just me 
'I prefer to 

~Prepare

'On a full stomach

Jordan honored

'fuck-tomorrow
'live for today
_

Food cooled to cold laid in front of bonfire
Each busy in a stationary-task

Hours of silence snowballed energies
Entangled to break an understanding

Stronger & stronger each passing second 
Entanglement-united in deep fight of will over all-else

Ben on a laptop
Jewels caligraphy, wiccan, potion 
Todd pen-set-out write down histories 
Jordan keep the fire & cook & knot

Hana made comments Jordan was the butler
Jordan replied she was promoted to his job

Miss lectured

'Starvation-bonds reach to deep wells of power

'Exploited by the effect of pseudo-starvation

'Hunger in proximity to smells-of-food 
'Will quick-trigger a state of pseudo-starvation
'Any attempt used all power to adquire food

'Hunger empower of Passangers
'If they were wakened of state

'Starved host receptive
'Passanger acute awake-distinct
'More powerful if both starved

'Lessons from the best masters yourself

'Difficult to attribute work to yourself
'Mostly-likely-direct-product of a Passanger

All now ate the cold food in deep gratitude
Somberness an ashe coats pleasures of life

Todd since a child devoted himself to edification
Meditation, supplication & fasts 

Father broke a long-line of religious tradition
All family-notables lived in religious service

Monks with well-written top
Meticulously preserved father after son

Tales of the lives of his lineage inspired him

Grand-father had a dark-side around children
Line forever now tarnished by one individual

Father quit the ministry 
Swore off religion & burnt the bridge 

Lived as pleasant life working 4 10s at the refinery
_

Todd never been to church with family
Father never once talked about grandpa

Todd only ever migrated church to church
To find respectable individuals

Dark cults or enlightened-masses
Each obvious to the beholder
_

Miss once drunk admited respect for Todd's intuition 
400 years put his example unparalleled

Pools of energy bloomed miracles in Todd's dream-state
He led hosts thru questions to fill holes of understanding
Tuned to the others frequency as bridge to pass messages 
_

Todd rants:

'I commit to morals
'Morals only modified 
'After any act itself
'To stand firm the main point

'Monuments of life 
'Done day-to-day

'New-doors opened-for-one 
'Opened to all-who-listen

'Each required to play part in fullest

'Jerk-off, play-tag, school
'All time sacrified
'For few life-long-ideals 

'Mathematical theory worked into notepads
'Pursuitant the reason why question asked

'Kung Fu kinetic logic infrastructure
'Stable actions as well-worn-responses

'Prayers allign mentalities
'Ease a sleepy-passanger into speak

'All morn kungfu wake me into algebraic-groups 

In stero-typical manner of all who do math
Ultimately to spend more time telling others of their hobby
_

Baby-blue-air lit to amber-orange
Deep summer day radiated heat

Full roar of ocean surrounded all

Waves full-bloom crashed
Four in the water

Manda with Jordan behind instructing her


'sync your jumps
'or the waves will crash you against the baracles

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
\\\\\\ Manda ready to return home to face her family
\\\\\\ All in the ocean with Manda tied to shore with rope
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Ben had previously mentioned to Todd

'Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's complete collection
'Pops stole them all one by one over 10 years 

'I also have alot of mathbooks

'They are at a storage-container
'We could haul the lot with our bikes

Jordan jumped down still dripping from last dive
Legs tucked to his odd-shaped-belly
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Jordan dumped his belly-flop

! hella-doe-boys

Long echoe into a crash of water
He swam over to the others

Jordan presented a plan

'We drop Manda off

He spoke to Ben

'On the way head to that stash of books

'Go thru the books
'Book no-one wants 

'slang-dat-shit 
'fat-wads all-day

Ben countered

'Or mad points
'With the library 
_

Hurricane devestated this section of the bay
Homes long-since-abandoned in decay
Reminder to all short-memory-real-estate-buyers & forginers

Five in a pack at night on desolate streets
Neighborhood was dark & villianous 

Certain paths led them best ways

** ** ** (stop)
Jordan looked back

** ** ** (stop)
Jewels flashed lamp-code

Three trucks charged together down the coast below
Headlights thru streets in the fastest route to the group

Jordan hooted in a small call

'shit-gonna-git-real

Section of the city vacant
Decrepit residential neighborhoods soggy 

Jordan put them thru the nearest cut-thru
Three street-blocks crossed diagonal

Juked debris & leaped fences
Jewels tome-busted passages thru several dead-ends 

Back on their bikes 
Rednecks not to be out-witted 

Roar of truck lurched near

Immediately a black mass
Dove into view thru the backyard

Woosh-of-disaster

Truck bouncing on Supper-Dude-Springs
It crashed thru debris front the krew

Hood over the engine a heavily-fortified hull 

Truck drifted-a-j over wet-foliage
Overwhelming in the overgrown yard

!!! HONK 

!!! HONK 
!!! HONK 
!!! HONK 

Dirt & plants blasted over collapsed fence set between them
Till it rained down over the next building

! damn dem der it is

! DATS

! Billys Bike

!!! GIT EM

A hardy-bearded-oldman screeched in wolf-howl
Stumbling-out drunk or dazed-stoopid-from-the-crash

'My late-wife
'Gave thatta my grand-son 

! Billy

Man stumbled out in a riot of cackles
In that empowered way to overcome sadness
Only theeth visble three brown teeth

! yall-gonna-paaaain

Speach allowed the krew time to pass out & thru

Two-other-trucks approached rapidly from other block
Enviornment grumbled in groans-of-the-rowdy-passage
_

Hauled-ass down perpendicular street

Movement as flock 
Jewels in the the lead 

They at times followed her to great pain
Unable to match Jewel's jukes failed into a painful tumble

They curved to circle into second-to-last-house 

Past the block only open grounds to leave them helpless against the stampeed

House, tho soggy, kept a sound-structure 
No-front-door allowed quick-entry

Swift headlights passed moments after

Todd whispered

! up-stairs

Trucks outside in mad charges as bulls
Nosed thru the neighborhoods lurching

Overestimating the stretch carried on
_

Trucks eventually pulled around to circle back

A voice shouted

'Billy keep dat outer-perimiter

'you understand dat sun

Old man illeterated

Ben took it running

'yeahit

Old man shouting to them

'We
'A gonna handle
'All this here

'That there bike
'Cost my dear wife some her life-savings

'& god-damned to yall
'If that helped her heark-attack

Old man called out into a hoot which curled to high pitches

! gaddamn-me
! for what we gonna do to yall

A hoarse, cracked teen voice yeller

'Run-em-down-dead
'As christ on the cross

Howls out windows 

! got my shotty
! pump-yer-ass-wit-salt

!!! ooooohhhhhwwwwwweeee 

!!! YIP

!!! saves-ya-to-feed-as-bacon-to-my-pigs

Five shadows moved as a group house to house
Pumped in riot & bashing deep-inspection 

Effort imperceptiple at such levels of intoxication
Not till umpteenth house the hunt became a labor
A hard & disgusting labor to search abadoned houses
Vomit-inducing sights met them unexpected

A fat man huffed to gather the squad

! you-wit-me
! bobby-go-wit-earl

' We got this house ere 

Hoots of compliance

!Chk er down
!chk ER down
!chk-er-down

Moments later a crash & bash down stairs
A crash at the stairs followed by a curse

! fuckaroo

'damn-fuck-cock-bite-stair
'jimmny-crickets-whore-of-a-mother


! BOBBY 
! EARL

! pull-er-ass-here
! help-me

A voice went outside to call out
Bobby, Earl & the trucks

! dumbass-dipshit-hurt-himself

Four others helped carry
Wounded grey-beard to a truck

Bobby yelled from his truck

! HEY YOUS
! FUCK FUCKAROOS

! DIS HERE TRUCK
! CALL HER


!!! RUMBLE
!!! RUMBLE 
!!! RUMBLE

! DOOOMM
! HAMMMERRRR

Loud-screech lost itself in the maniacal throttle & Heavy Metal on 808s

Truck logo:

~Bobbys Best
~WRECK & CLEANUP

! ole-mother-fucker
! designed to clear this shit
! how-fucking-funny-is-that-boys

' done't earnt
' yerselves proooofesssionales

A shrill accusative yipped 

! THiEVry

Justified the truck took out the corners of the first house 
Down their side of the block

Two on each side of truck linked the chains to the pillars of each house

One worker shouted glove on the right hand
A fith-of-something-cheap in his left hand
Leather-utility-belt hung a laborer-hammer

! I-aINTA-WURKED-DiS-HaPPy-SINCE-VEGAS
_

Pace & efficiency alarmed the group

Jordan trapped in despair

~fuck-oh-fuck

'Gotta keep it real

Todd pointed thru lookout window

'They left the hurt guy in the smaller truck 

'Imma sneak up behind
'Take him down

Todd convinced them

'We only survive if we get a vechicle
'With bikes we lose

Jordan offered

'Take over the truck then reverse here
'We throw the bikes in the bed 

'Skurr-skurr for sure
'You got this Todd
'Ill back you up

Todd declined

'I move better alone
'Just be ready

Todd's tactic relied on surprise
Two meant double-chance to be noticed 

Failure sacrified Todd as distraction 
Chance for others to escape an otherwise sealed-fate

Hand-to-hand combat a dependable solution

Todd left out the kitchen window
To follow bushes along the front

Section after section Todd steathily-crept 
Snail-movements put him under rear-cab driver-window

A locked-driver-door meant his luck ended 
Tonight not their night to die

A solid thrust up the handle locked-halfway

A voice inside rose

'whadda

! whatdafuck 

Todd's heart dropped
Passanger prepared trick 

~Back Bed

Todd luckily placed in good position  to swing himeself onto the back bed

Truck lurched as Todd scrambled upright
Four wheel drive thru rumble of the front bushes

Todd on a bull-of-a-ride
Thrown hard here-&-there

Guy caught-up in manual-transmission with one unusable foot
Old man meant to get to the other truck 

Rednecks always have something in the bed able to break a window
Todd took hold of a metal-rod

Truck-bed jolted left in airborne jump
Truck crashed his shoulder into a tool box

Wheels purchased pavement again
Todd bleeding but no time to tend wounds

Todd immediately obliterated the back window 
Over-swung-rod continued to a red-line across the-head

! yyyyeaaaaoooohhhhhh

Driver experienced to safe-habits saved both their lives
Todd tossed inside among frantic inter-actions of transimission & gas

Todd mid-air hips planted drivers skull into the windshield

'ArGGRreh

Old-man grunted stoopidly
Vehicle stopped dead in a bush

Other truck busy gathering-the-men had caught themself in a mud-pit
Only knew how to rememdy the situation as a pack of trucks

Old-man keen on life
He opened the door & let himself roll safetly to grass

Todd took the truck hard twice

Old-man crackled in shock

! fucking-manual
! motherfucker
! gaddamngears

Todd threw his handsign
Right leg & hand moved independent

Truck lurched reverse & spun right towards his friends
Todd kept 1st gear till the house roaring in RPM

Truck of rednecks first tended to the old man 
Family first over vengance

Attempts to honk at Billy left unanswerd

Todd's body screamed in pain
He stopped outside the house

Flumbling out like-wise the oldman

Ben took the wheel 

Jewels & Jordan hauled Todd into the truck-bed

Miss went work to patch up Todd & set back broken bones 

Jewels massaged Todd's wounds with a balm as he slept
Pepper-balm-sand-clay-scub 

Peppermint prepared leaves to layer afterwards 
All coated by root-oil to encase Todd in herbs
_

Todd patched up & able to rest in the cab of the truck
All grateful to be in-doors

Jordan spoke

'Manda we drop you off
'Can we leave Todd with you

Manda kept unresponsive

Concoction blotted Todd unconciousness
Todd hauled thru Manda's window 
_

Jordan directed Ben

'Lets haul all the books now

Supermart closes in an hour

' Lets do a supply dash
' Unless yall too tired

Jewels

~ nah fk that
~ you dont wanna go
~ you sleep imma eat
_

Ben underestimated the quantity of books Pops stole
Jordan & Jewels left to filter all books into two piles
He first drove to the utility-shed to stash the food
_

Jordan stood outside the glassdoors of the Library

'aye

! tack 
! tack 
! tack

Reluctant guard eventually came to the door

!4am 

!outtahere
!libraryclosed

Same guard from the years back
He turned making his way back to his lounge

Jordan yelled back
! truck in parking-lot packed stolen-book

Guard ignored him too tired to care

An hour & the involvement of the other guard
Required to get the guard back up

'Dude
'Im fucking serious

Jordan assuring him as he opened the door

'hella-books in a truck

Guard unbought

'Yeah & Yeah fk-off dip-shit 
'library closed

Jordan caught back 

'You dont remember me? 

Gaurd now woken complete

'Oh yeah I remember you
'I remember you stole from me
'After I fed you

Guard about to snap

'dick with me today... 

Jordan speechless-from-sadness disarmed the guard
Guard subsided to follow Jordan into the lot

! fuck

A tarp bound the buldged mass of books
Several fell to the pavement as if leaking

Guard jaw-dropped

'Shit-load-of-books

Guard looked back in friendship reknewed
Redeemed from the sharp pains of betrayal

'You just got me promoted 
'Thanks Jordan

Jordan only able to nod & let the guard get busy
Reconciliation a comptemplation to keep him the next hours
Three packed the book & supplies thru the rabbit-path

0 BEN 00000000000000000000000

Walking dark streets at a brisk
Something mechanical in his hands

After quick-glances all-directions at the corner 
He wrapped a bungee-cord around the post

Mechanical-device set on the cord to point towards the street
Lasers set the camera scan of the intersection for traffic

Passing cars triggered a recording-feed-alert via radio
Feed linked to a screen banded to his arm 

6 of them set up
2 minutes of estimated reaction to prepare
In that window of time he was sure of anything 

He crossed the street to verify the device
Arm-Band lit up with his potato-quality-image
_

Warehouse at the docks sat alone in the open expanse of the lot
Waves crashed at the corner of the open lot in heavy sprays

Network scans revealed this location as a common gateway
Weeks to prepare for this night
Coiled ropes & cords flopped outside of his pack

Street front the open-lot he paused to center-chi & handsign

'find the office
'find the gateway 
'hack the gateway

'Run this cable along the gate
'Set it up to the city-utility-connector

He turned & pointed to a green box at the end of the lot 

'New cable will upgrade the connection
'Which I will slightly tax

He went forward in a rush of energy

'Keep tabs on my wrist
'When it lights up be sure 
'Nothing is missed

~show-time-muthrfkrs
~keep-it-real

Late hour kept alerts down

Man approached the fence

'Probed an oceanside-window last-week

'Security checks up a few times a night
'No system to the timing

Along the fence waited two-minutes with no feed

He only needed 20 seconds
Nike-Free soles molded to the fence
He jumped up & over in fluid-silence 

Fences his expertise
Preferred hurdle to set tween chasers 

Movements direct & pre-planned 
Base of the two-story office-building in quick cover

He looked up to the window probed last week
A loory alerted & passed 

Took off his pack & un-latched the rope
One-end clean-bowline achored to a thick-pipe 

Window-ledge hoisted jump to a solid throw
Rope now set for the ascension & rappel

Sensitive the man responded
'GriGri
'Dont know whatcha call it
'Every-possib has em
'Simple physics really

Opened the mechanism to demonstrate the core

'Main point is find it
'These will save your life

Hand ascension set quickly with carribeaners
He set the line with his weight to walk vertical

Quiet-movements swift in a flow
Done in Qui-Gong breathing-techniques

Feed-alert flushed him against the window

He worked open a rusty window with a thin steel piece
Remarkably similiar to Jordan's tho looked decades older

Slipped his body narrowly inside & shut window

'Only leave windows open if there is danger

Musty-warehouse ordor with wiffs of fish-reek
Office-quarters sectioned into cubicles

'You expected fish-smell? 
~weird

Family-portraits & anti-stress-toys on desks

After quick inspection of the floor 
He tested the locked stairwell door

Network lines followed into a locked-closet
Whur of computers inside assured the location of the gateway-box

A pouch removed from off the pack
Only after clumsy effort the door opened

He used two extremely thin-yet-strong rods

Inside with laptop out & on
Ready for the mission

A bogus label on the laptop

-DNS SERVER-
-KEEP ON-

-network will not work if off- 

New cable to connect laptop between gateway-box & ISP box 
A new label placed on the company-gateway

-troubleshoot
-check DNS server on

Gateway-box had a sticker detailing the network of the Internet Serice Provider

Information directly configured into the laptop kernel
No need to get into the gateway-box

Man-In-The-Middle attaches between two point & pretends to each end, itself, the other end 

ISP->MitM->gateway
gateway->MitM->ISP

Ben woke from dream & wrote it down 
A photo on a clerk's desk called out to him

Family around a sign on a sandy beach
~Pilgrims Pennesula
Icon of the characteristic-coastal-bay engraved

He recognized the part of the coast
_

Dunes spring time
Jordan out snorkling with Todd

Tide nice & calm 
Skaters waited their turn on the beach
Mandarins thrown around 

! kingpin

Skaters greeted Ben
Clay Dorsey Javi & Homer

Ben joined them & caught an fruit 
He waited for Jordan & Todd to return
_

Jordan replied to Ben

? Pilgrim's Pennensula

'Never heard of it

Ben drew the shape with his fingers upon wet sand 

'Shape of the engraving
'Put it just south of the Bluff
'Right there

Jordan smirked

'no-shit-murlocks
'Well thats the answer

'Not much of a vacation spot
'In this reality

'I been out there once

'Maps read it to be a NeverLand
'Miles from no where
'Fresh spring water

'I get there eventually 

He paused for their meal
_

Clay didn't know how to place Jordan
Jewels a bmx Legend
Ben the kingpin-hacker
Todd an odd-ball elitist

Jordan normal as any kid
Yet he always spoke to an understanding next-level-astounding

All been up since last night
Water gleamed off round shoulders

Last night they got to boasting
Pull-ups essential for upper-body-strength 

Made a competition out of it
Each to arrive at end & see where each strength settled

Jewels bored after thousands

Pull-ups best eased into over time
Stretch mandatory

Jewels instructed them

~  Grab arms-out-streched over-head
~  Lay-out abdomen 
~  Strech as bow

~  Hold elbows over-head 
~  Lean right & left
_

Pull-ups noticably power their bunny-hops

Leaping over a fence happens hourly at night

Feeder-by-turns
One would anchor his skateboard
Krew one-at-time run get up on the skateboard to be heaved in aided-launch

Up in the air to glide into a landing
Favoring the skateboard in first contact of the roll
Then helmet then pack

Each in turn first to fly
Lauched with skank-out-as-flag

Next up used skank to land & guide the rest
_ 

Jordan continued his story
Hardly a meal fruit-no-meat

~so-yeah
'About the Bluff

'I finally end up there

'hella-before-dusk

'Ready to bail back to the city 

'Found it a perfect place
'Set up camp & nighted deep into it

'Believe-me I could hardly sleep

'This place a Neverland
'Hours scheming new options 
'Infinte places to set-up camp

'Soon as sun went down
'Buzzes filled the air

'Swarm black against black night
'Worst night of life

'Kept all night gripping my bag shut
'Bugs collided into sack all night

Jordan made a tsssss at Ben

'If you go out there
'tssss

'You deserve what you get

Todd felt a draw towards it

'We go tonight

Jordan face-back-attitude 

'Da-fk
? Only to troll

Todd reassured him

'Full moon should keep bugs-down 

Jordan palm-face 
Ben took up the challenge 

'I bet 4 supply trips
'Place a landmark-tourist-attraction

Jordan took it

'Bay took almost a century to clear out
'Logically the Bluff an ideal first-landing

'But with all the hurricanes
'Any place would have cleared out long ago

Well assured any nights suffering 
Worth four free runs

Jordan least busy yet he treasured idleness

'Prob different in this existence

Clay broke in

'Dorsey you in

Dorsey declined

'Nah
'Chill at the beach
'Imma hit up Sabrina 

Clay settled it

? Out far
'You need bikes right
_

Back down to their core 5
Out to the highway 

Dismounted & walking with bikes for the feeder
Hitching a ride southside the oceanside-highway

Over-sized truck pulled over
Eager to make-use-truck-bed

Scratchs & dents 
Marks of reputation in Texas

Man at about 50 wearing a decade-old truckers-hat

'Yall take trip this late
'Not much to do out our way

Jordan replied

'There is a party 
'Southside at the Bluff
'Ben-here gots a date

Jordan nudged-openly at Ben

Call getting the old man's hoot

Travel-moochers must be good company
For-karmas-sake

Old man now jeered

'Throw yall bikes in da back
'Cab big enough
'yall come inside

'Pray someone gets laid tonight
'I aint got no possibility now
'Old-hag divorced me
'Took everything but this-here-truck
'Put this fine-lass in the PreNup

His meaty-hand slaped the dash hard proving-the-rig

Jordan always kept their packs in front when hitching
A good barrier & first-contact-pad if one had to jump-out

Old man cackled-loudly the entire time 

'Any particular place on the bluff?

Ben put in

'HEB 
'we need to get a few things

Oldman parked front-the-store

'Im just around the corner
'If I see yall again 
'I pick ya up

Jordan asked crawling down the truck 

'Can we get you a 6-pack

Oldman's eyes glinted
Hooting into the night

'Moonshine keeps my figure

He didn't get this old 
Letting youngers buy him alcohol
_

Fresh supplies always hard-got
Stores hevanly places of plenty

Jewels gave props to Jordan

~ ace-hitch

Jordan smiled back

'Yeah that geezer legit 

'We can scout a base
'Camp eazy-time-to-spare

'Test out our new mega-net
_

Cashier looked upset by their selection
Obnoxious-in-cost & too-much-to-carry

Bandages behind his ears hid-tattoos
Black long hair sleek hid-the-bandages


'Those bikes yours out front

Cashier jocked at their bags

Ben fished info out of the cashier 

'There is a party here tonight
'Pilgrims Pennesnula

Worker started-up 
Oily thin strands of hair stuck-to-his-startled-expression

He turned & looked side-to-side then to face them

'Kay first
'never mention Order matters here

'Kay idiots

He leant in closer all bro

'Tonight 

~at midnight yall
~is-gonna-be
~HELLA

Clerk sang into a low-whispered-dance

'Just keep on Jalisco
'Straight after the barrier
'Just wait your turn on the train

Deep-folds-of-skin on his neck leaked oily sweat

! it-gonna-be-tittys 

'So wassup girl 
'See-you-tonight

Worker appraised Jewels figure
Muscular legs in stockings & shorts
_

'A-holy-fk-this-wind
Jordan grunted a ways down Jalisco

Main street of the town to terminate here
At a straight-shot back to town 

Ben shouted
Bags anchored in such wind

'Better-than-bugs

Jordan yelled

'Stash sup & bikes

'Find a bush
'Eyeshot to the barrier

He pointed at the road-blocked steel arm
Gate locked off vehicles to the area

Todd chirpped 

'I wonder 
'What possibilities would have been
'Without the hitch

'So many random-events
'Create such drastic trajectories

Jewels faced Todd 

~Or they 
~Drawn to us
_

Sting of sand brought packs-up to protect their faces
A mile & half past barrier end of the pavement

Puddled dirt path led forward 
Each turn more extreme

Tire treads scarred earth in deep imprint
Mud pit after mud pit impossible to most vehicles

Jordan pointed to a hilltop
Lone it loomed over the bay

'Deer paths better
'Than this shit-cake-show

Miss spoke out

'This part of the bay 
'Hit-gold round the 60s
'Karma swept it all away

Gray-clay clung each step 
Streaks smeared along calves

Sanded-wind no longer a blight to them
Wind blocked by the extreme up & downs of the passage

Jordan happy

'No bugs yet this path aint so bad
'Only got to carry a de-shitter-stick

Jordan gave an example
Scraped clay off his shoe in one movement of a stick

Jewels a nervous wreck to keep her Tome clean

Thickets dense yet always with animal-traffic
Trails connected into mazes of paths 

Hilltop visible most times

Miss stopped them with a whistle

! whiirp 
! whiirp

Jewels set her pack down to kneel
She gathered a bush of dense aromatic-herb
Clippers & twine Jewels made four sachets

~rare
~good luck

All wore leather cords to drape sachets 
Flagged them amoung others as distinct

Bags of dried herbs & fortune charms

Todd regained strength

'This place aint so great 
'Even-without Jordans monster bugs

Toke & refreshments 
Then they mounted packs

Up a steep hillside
Thicket trunks as ladder to climb at-times
_

Hilltop suddenly broke-away to panorama

Dark shoreline illuminated under moon
Great waves of the ocean hurled into near-by-beachs
Outcrops of dark boulders in the distance

Jordan lamented & pointed 

'Buildings south-west 
'50 feet inland

'Off the barnacle outcropping

'You can see the straight shadows of the roofs

Ben without doubt only waiting eventuality 

'You should have known better to bet against me ole-boy
'How long you gonna survive
'If you bet against people like me

'Four runs full of computer equipment & the like

They set up camp in the sunset
Stitched-together mosquito-nets

Clouds now-only-parted after sunset
After return with the supply-bags

Jewels danced around serving herself Twinkis
~ feast all now
~ HEB way back

Jordan

'Even the hike not too difficult
'This may have been our most smooth adventure yet

Jewels smacked him back the head

Jordan recoiled sorrowful

'muthrfkr-I-cursed-dam-it

Open hilltop enshrouded by the thickets 
Summit a small barren area eye-shot to beach

Camp set secluded below the sand-worn-platau
Deer trails led only those who knew how to read deer-trails

They left camp to inspect the site

Jordan got them on a straight shot to the beach
Beach walk shoeless to the distant buildings

~Pilgrim Pene... 
A sign half-buried-by-an-accumulating dune to the side

Ben pulled it out

'Exact same logo

Jewels signed at Ben
~trippy

Miss long-since asleep in her belly
Jewels woke her up with a burt

Miss burrowed her way up
Got set up all right
Then rapt Jewels on the head

All buildings degraded from decades of age 
All heavily-boarded as to block all entrance

Ben gave-up 

'To get inside any of these required
'Half the building torn down

Trucks roared in the distance

Pack followed Ben's dream to the Bluff
Frontier of thickets & road-for-crawlers-only

Hilltop at the Bluff overlooking the beach
Once named Pilgrims Pennesula
Wiped from maps

Crawlers arrived loud & slow
Each trick-to-shit-truck hull connecter to the aft of the forward

Only pulled or one drug
Each to their slow crawl

Drivers comminicated to the whole via lights
Driver communicated to their front-back via radio

Each on swing in a tree top an over-looking hill

Jordan accused Miss

'Why didnt you tell us

Miss look backed ignorant

Jordan called it bullshit

'That building-wood less than 
'the-fk-long-your-centuries

'I know you know I know
'So just so you know
'I know

Miss fluttered her umbrella 

'Hey a bet is a bet
'If you would have backed out

'You would only have lost sooner

'I like to see these things 
'Played out naturally

Jordan unsatisfied but beaten

Miss assured him

'You loser face is so cute Jordan

In turn passing binoculars

Rednecks in merriment of logistics

Barrel-man some type of mix between pagan-pope & local-drunk
seed-far-fallen from German ancestry

Moonshine in an over-sized-wooden-barrel
Wood bound with steel with its steel pour-knob glinted

Calves of man thick as monster
Keg hauled on back or hug out-front

Jordan lost in amazemnt 
Himself couldn't manage those feats even without load

All had cerimonial gauntlet
Eager when their time came

~to be washed 

What looks like they called it from binoculars

Each once cup filled-to-brim 
Take it down all at once-handsigns

Barrel man a certain-type-of-mix
Between pagan-pope & local-drunk

! vroooooooom 
! vroooooooom 

Headlight beams upon low-clouds 

Firewood netted-down on truck-beds
As-if an entire forest to be sacrificed

Each helped haul the other 
A train-of-trucks connected by chains

Each pulled the other along in turn
To unlink at the beach
Dunes set up with a launch run
Sent sacrifices Dagon way

One charged fearless up the runaway and shot off the ramp
Rocks & sand sprayed as it landed then slid in a skilled-stop 

Jay-drifting bed-flap released nets archoring the firewood
Rocketing the loose-fire-wood into an accumulated mountain

Over 100 trucks arrived
Trucks all parked neatly single file

Light flickered in blazed of enormous bonfires
Buildings all operable in service

Booths of live animals
Fortune telling & street-magicians

Merriment wasted on alcohol

One truck hauled a tethered cage
Truck after truck hauled a tethered cage on a rail
Truck jolt off a sacrificed animals into deep-sea

First anchored-chickens then pigs then sheep
Goats were the oddest-acting-creatures when flying
Each looked as if it excepted to one day fly
_

Robesman made rites aroudn the bonfire pillar
A great thin fog froze as monolithic-clouds

Each driver with gas in the gauntlet
Siphoned from their tanks
Tithes to fire-pit 

Party-a-coil around the fueled mountain 
Summons audible on winds

A dark object arose from the sea
Long form drew the LochNess dragon

Large fins stepped to the beach
It approached the erected wood

A flash of strike invisible to the hilltop
Lochness sniped half the body of a man
Which it flung up & crunched down 

In a great roar the dragon stood upon hind legs
Falling into a bellow & flame-lashing-as-whip
Aun hilltop shuddered as the creature landed

LochNess returned to the deep
Bonfire lit up in explosions that lauched several logs

Aquatic-beings arose from the deep 
Some took the wounded invitingly 

Dance drank & mate 
Intoxicated merriment

Dragon retreated into the horizon
LochNess head visible as distant sentinel

Tentacles foamed out at the shallows
Tentacles stretch miles from deep-abyss

Source megolithic past scape-of-view against ocean landscape
_

Auquatic Robesmen in odd-shapes joined those on the beach

Encircled the crowd from ruckous into silence to chants
Odd-aquatic-hums of deep-water

Line hand-bound uncoiled towards the deep
Towards the outcrop of barnacled boulders

Men & Women & Fish-people in odd-orgy 
Foamy-tentacles the medium of sexuality

Tentacle-nipples sucked body in lustful-pleasures
A prescion to expound pleasures hundred-fold

Electric-plup-sacks-soft-yet-firm-jelly
Tingled refined-levels-of-inticement

Tentacles hairy of all types & color
Hair striked as whips to naked flesh

Distant human forms flung up upon cum
Caught and cleansed in waves by god-like-appendages

All unkoothe
_

Green glow lit the horizon
Believed to be illuminesent-algae 

In time it drifted distict & apart
A single small orb drew all in a light
Light more a fog than a billiance 

Impossible detail opened to Todd
Green glow pulsated hungrily

Emerald-green-orb folded into golden scales 
Set top a scepter in fine-ways of master-craftsman
A hermaphadite-god enlaid upon it as crest
_

Monstrosity flailed in the high-winds hours
Tentacles fucked-all-one-to-another as puppets

Man woman tentacle intertwined to monolitic movements
Rolls of flesh in vibrating unity

Foamy-scenes of garganteuam-enviornment
Sex-smell thick in the dense-foggy-air

Ride over all dismounted in a beach-ward swim 
Chain of victims linked by arm walked into water

Unlinked & snapped up by tentacles
Shriest & cries & terror drawn to an end of utter-need

Lust of the tentacles gripped each in deep care
Pulpus forms molding & humped aggressively 
Nipples now hard knobs

Foam spouted out of the orafices
Hotly layering the naked bodys

Great shocks of electricity sparked-arcs tentacle-to-tentacle
Air filled with wails of the deep pleasure of pain

Air now all hot in steam-of-it
Sauna of sexual particles

Orb out-shone full-moon in bright-green-glow 

Each person upon release locked in stasis of electricity
Blue light iluminated the frozen-forms

Each in turn awakened caught in full-bloom-of-lust

A freshness devoured tastily
Mouth crunched & smacked noiseily

5 Students in a library on the second floor
On a balcony overlooking the floor below

Government officals stood attent 
Children presented their impossible-discoveries 
Rings of power set in velvet boxes

Rings tracked-down against all odds
Items of legend to world-wide-press 

Attained by these children
Easily as if rings awaited them

Students honored & proud

Jordan's voice spoke inside

~aint-gonna-git-me-suckah

'muthrfkrs are ganking you

Kid took the hint whole-heartily
Immediately before the boxes collected

In feint manuverd by Jordan
He re-lifted the LOCHNAR ring
As he closed the box-lid

Green-orb reassured his palm with warmth

Officals promptly recited their routine-disclaimer

'You will have no more dealings with these matters
'Any attempt would mean the end of your family-line

'You service to this government will not be forgotten

Military Police saluted then escorted them out briskly

Cast-shattered-faces-of-friends

If not for quick thought himself like-wise
If not for the quick odd-thought & grab

Government all on the upper-floor
A swarm in relish of the spoils

Kid quick out at bottom level
But one of his mates quicker
He ran up

'Hey I saw you
'You didnt give yours

Mate shoved the kid back towards the second-floor

'You will get all our families killed

Undaunted the kid pushed ahead 
Outmatched-mate yelling vengeful

! He took the LOCHNAR
! He took the LOCHNAR

Typically ignored by adults
Drowed in celebrations 

All who knew the call's significance
Too deep in the party to hear
-

LOCHNAR a trusted-friend after months
Kid out submersed in the streets

Rings of Power drifted as winds
Past thru owners as one grasps air

Kid recovered several of the rings

Red-gem called to him in drunken-state
Gem in possession of several thugs

Those thugs now circled the kid's krew
Krew small-looking but elite in strength

'Heard you been asking all around
'about ruby jewlery

Cocky kid provoked back
This would be stealing-from-children

? You got it

Man flashed up into a rage at the bait
Courtyard exploded full of rumble of the rough & tumble

LOCHNAR in the end subdued the thugs

Ruby jewel jumped away under a night-stand
Kid knelt down to retrieve the ruby 

Out came a little spider

'oh sir oh sir
'we serve we serve
'to you to you
'sacrifice sacrifice

Gray of hairs in semblance of royal ancestry
Majestic mane a coat of many grays

'Eight Legs Eight Legs
'Many eyes Many eyes
'All yours All yours

Kid agreed compliance

Spiders after milenium in waiting to rebuild kingdom by the Ruby

00000000000000

Under hot-tarps mid-day till sleep available
Breakfast-dinner & de-camped over a light-fire 

No trace had been left of the night
Gulls cleaning up had an over-sized greatness

Jewels knew that one of the 100 had spotted our bikes
Yet Jordan proved true again 
Tho admittedly the bikes were out-in-the-open

! CAR

Texas flat-lands allowed plenty warning to a car approach at night
Past midnight but sweating in the humid night

Krew dove into a secluded-spot
Aided by the camo attached to their packs

Scotty tandem with his new gir Kitty

Scotty begged that Jewels get him the bike
Then all journey out to the Garden

Jewels figured Scotty easily owed the bike 

~Bye Bye
~Sweet American Pie

Hummed in the faith, tonight the two would lose-virginty
Garden a perfect place Scotty promised Kitty 

Kitty plump-perfect-breasts
Breasts hung heavily yet perky

All under load 

Jewels had the Tome & mixtures
Jordan hauled firewood on trailer
Ben had tarps & supplies,
Todd hauled-all-else using Jewel's trailer

Old one-pump-station marked the midway
Always visted on the trips to stock up

Krew full speed non-stop
Store longsince-shutdown

Familiar smell grumbled Jordan's stomach

Jordan heartless-filled Todds-trailer
Now all thankful for Jordan

Dark-clouds passed-brisk in bay-winds
Bright moon faded in eclispes of clouds 

Contrast empowered Jewels to embue powerful spirits
Hillside her tools laid out on the grass on a work-blanket

Soctty had all in a stir with his sweaty work
Tho impossibly larger above
Hill in such times too small

Moon high when Scotty & Kitty returned
Aura bloomed into the maturity of satisfaction
Ultimate satisfaction of naught-else-higher

Scotty iceberged the titanic-of-awkward
Explained holding Kitty bashfully

'Kitty these are their states 

Scotty counted them down for her

'Brew state gave powerful dreams
'Smoke state to inspire them before journeys
'Balms to calm imflamations of deep meditations
'Edible state purged them before fast

Jordan ventured freely

'Due to the feminine-lure of drugs
'We five are often blitzed in those states

'In fact Todd calls it meditation

Jordan shot at Scotty

'Remember the waffle-maker

Scotty jumped on Jordan to silence him
Now the frozen hillside erupted in shatters

Jewels imediately filled the vacancy next to Kitty

~ Miss go to sleep

Miss startled

'Well now 
'hear me
'...before 
'you give me a bed tiMe...

Jewels stuffed Miss down & into stomach

Awestruck by it Kitty looked-back-up to Jewels
Eyes big of questions & girl-talk

~ tell me
_

Night wore on

Jewels prepared a faggot with Kitty
Embued by the energies of sexuality
	weed, flowers, dried herbs
	weed, driftwood, dried-sea-plant
	honey, leaf, 
All wrapped in a leather-tabacco-cord

Jordan's bonfire which once raged
Now it only a deep-slumber-red-coals

Tea while inhaling faggot
Wind directed their puff-puff

Ben's tarp formed a Tea-Pee
Around the encircled-fire

Hot-box-tee-pee

Vibes resonated the vibrance of spring-night

Kitty blushed to cherry awe 
Enamor Jewels first ever-understanding of the beauty of blood

Kitty in a state-of-being
So long imagined now lived

She took Scotty across the lake again

Cat unabashed to follow & creep from the bushs

All sexuality perked 
Kitty fk-else-fks-loud

Fingers into the balm Jewels snuck her
Spread over her nipples & then her clit

~oh the good ole 
in-out in-out

She sang in a pleasure of pain

Jewels been awaiting it
Burst into a seizsure of laughter

Yet nothing could tarnish a scene of Kitty lustful
_

Jewels out among the plants

Todd chewed a cluster of mint & cane cross-legged 
A comfortable desk kept here to write atop 
Start of the session of night-prayers
First above-all-else give-thanks

Ben over laptop powered 
He mostly first read logs

~logs are the flow of code
~understand the code by observing the flow

'Events of a system
'A cloud where one area affects rest

Pondering ambient ideas from logs

Mountain-top in snow-caped Asia
Teen on a trail-run up the ridge

Path of it only difficult & narrow
Death only consequence of mis-composure

Night put this path impassable
Aun no place to sit

Slopes all drastic & divergent
Smoothe to prevent retrace on this maze

Ancestors kept this vale sacred
Journey for the boldest-of-heart

Mission to fill two buckets
All the weeks sacred supply
To present to goverment goons

Their villiage enslaved

Teen answered the sentiment

'In this reality 
'Everyone is a slave

'A lone mountain spring
'Drip by drip by drip 
'Once a week spring fills a small pool
'Large enough for these two buckets

Steel rungs on each end of the staff hooked the buckets
Sturdy iron-wood-staff laid in steel & gold

This sacred relic allowed to be non-stripped

'Precious symbol of subjection & servitude
'Aun our mountain god

'But they are fools who know little of us
'Scrolls fortell a hero born from these slopes
'One prophisized to free the people

'He would never fall to the pits of the spring

'I have yet to fall in the pits all these years

Year after years on trails to train him
Paid too good to stop
No other bold enough
Every runner has died without exception

Passage across an art
Technical expertise in a finesse only permited-way

Necessary-outlet out of opressed-existence
Allowed to roam here free

Out here naught could lord him
Out here he king of the world

World as far as eye could see
'As long as you don't look over that slop

Trail ended before breaching ridge
Ridge of dark peaks like great spires

Runner could only stay in this desolate place as King
Until a meal came to mind

If another meal wanted
Necessary to return before night-fall

Todd amazed by the mastery of complex movements

Hip warm-ups the vital key

Low to the ground 
Buckets anchor points

Movements of a kung-fu master
Todd learnt deep paths 

Animal forms applicable to the present obstacle
Camel Mantis Crane Monkey Russian Bear Turtle Mouse Drunk 

Staff balanced on his neck he clasped his palms

Handsigns swiftly-executed 
Dab of precious olive-oil 

'Slavery will not break me
'Here subjucated as all are

'Tho slave 
'I am your master

'Proported powerful-being

'Here with nothing-to-my-own
'Built a marvel to all eyes

'Life in pursuit
'Of this simple mastery

'Tai Chi Qi Gong
'Breathe in
'Keep your center
'Breathe out & move

'Extend or contract
'Breathe in & keep your center

'Staff a double-polar-end 
'Stable four vector anchor

He tightened one hand & pulled with the other
With a whip of the back, the steel ignited against a rock

Once proud boulder chipped-off a good chunk

Todd able to speak

'I am of a tribe of Corpus
'Five of us live as nomads

'A comsic deity known as Dagon
'Will consume all possibility connected

Todd felt the lump down his throat

'We are fated to lose

'We are to learn how to kill his-image 
'Then we have to kill him 

Slave responded

'Always in dealings with fate
'Correct answer always to fight fate

'LOCHNAR has chosen you

'A power which when recieved empower all connected

'Act the night of moons-green-glow
'Fortune to use-opportunity

Todd caught a tight terror
He said nothing of LOCHNAR

Slave continued to fill his buckets

'Time to end the summons
'I never summon & trek

Todd braved out

'I can get you over the ridge

Slave cocked back

'That idea means succed or die all-in-from-the-start
'Passangers always act too rashly

Todd promised

'There is always a trail
'One to the top of the ledge
'Climb 20 meters up the other side
'To apex of the gorge
'You will find a deer trail
'I will lead you there myself
'Next lunar rotation be here
'Do not bring supplies or any unusual

Slave shot back

'There are never deer in this valley

Todd put it simply

'Then up there is your proof
'There a way out of the valley

Late spring-night on school-grounds

Groupings of tables by ledges 
Scene lit by yellow circles of outside-lights

Rear the school at the lunch-yard
Out-of-sight of any police passing
Too large a pack to heed security-guards
Security-guards rather-not call the police

Three packs joined up at this spot
A rollerblade crew invited by Scotty

Jewels stunted large

Ben of the undernet

Short-board-kid laid out a yarn in admiration

~hella-yea-boi

'Even soldt KEY$
'To three! teachs at school

$KEY pronounced ski

Short-board-kid counts off

'dealers second-handers hobos 
'taco-stand ...

Short-board-kid called out 

'Troy

Troy ethralled by the spell of watching Jewels stunt around
Dragged from the show

! Jewels
`Yo that inhuman
! We cant compete 

Jewels kicked up into flip
Shrugging-shoulders

~ so 

Troy blushed in appreciation
Needed a moment to calm down

Kid repeated again

'whats your weridest $KEY sell

Troy twirled his long-board 
Hopped on it in nose dive

'your mom is one

Dropped a 5-stair & rolled back
Troy backed the short-board-kid off 

'No joke I was at HEB

'Your mom talked to some other lady
'Recognized me & ran over

SBK got all up on him
But he didnt let up

'Please do you have a KEY dollar-sign

'Im all like uh... ski

'ohhh then she started to beg
'like a dog in front of bacon
'all drooly n wanting the meat

There was a less-than-friendly rumble
The most notable hurtful being the grunt

'Couldnt say no to a 
'your-mommy-sloppy

Just-learned-ollie-skater quick-shot Ben for points
Ben took up the offer to challange

The trial elongated as was the Bluff
Here without gray-clay
Appreciation bounced him since

Ben using Tome as a ramp
Rocketed on the table

bunny-hop-table-to-table 

Each table in line hit 
360 to land

A flash-of-ginger took him immediately
Full-body into a dense bush

Jewels taught Ben using her Tome was not okay
Ben angry-as-hell

'Hey I tested it out
'Did you a favor

'If it can hold me
'It may hold your cave-man-ass

Too-family in a friends-situation
Jewels burned of the energy of the insult 

All enjoyed the scene as proud-witness
Ben squeeled over & over like a pig

Ben's embarassmant eased eazy after
Night unmarred all kept to good moods

Rollerbladers yell all-sniff-up

! now lets tag-tonight

Punks now demolished & tagged automatic-in-response

Deep-night split-up & regrouped at an abandoned lot
Rollerbladers promised dirt hills for the bikes

Calm pure-humidity of early-morn
World slowly warmed to activity in the start of a new day

Troy lit up a Black & Mild
Tabacco cigar wrapped over a wood filter

Rollerblader fronted

'We do this all the time
'Tonight was best of all

? Yall nights all like this

Jewels stood up passing the blunt

~study worse over school

Long-night of renegade-fuckery
Body battle-worn from jukes & tricks

All weary for sleep went own ways
Cops be on look-out the next days

Mid-day weekends before summer
Packs out still-energized of reserves from long-winter-months

An old bank
A neighborhood spot

It didn't offer any advantage exceptional
Cept for a long-mostly-smooth-lane

Kids here got rocket-ollies well-worked

Jewels caught breath
All else in hopes to talk to her

A crowd teleported to her after the trick 
Mostly kids who only hyped due to hype of other kids

Scotty & dealers under a tree in pow-wow
He hustled edibles-Jewels-made at a high price

Turnt on pull yet confident enough to transact
Dealers sagging Jinco jeans eyes-low-chill

'Dense bro
'Sure man we 

OG coughed out the Black & Mild 

~cough-oh-geezzz-too-high

'Yo Erick get the wad

He turned back to them

'Yea we will get the lot

OG approved openly to the scene

'Scotty is cool

All quickly resumed as if uninterrupted
Dealer motioning to break-out-here

Grinder-skaters set a pipe between trucks on a skateboard
Erik unscrewed pipe & popped out wads

'We hot
'so yall know

Dealer fished out a free nick sack & flung it at Ben

'Our product legit Jamaican

'It got a name

'There was a reason I didnt mention it
'But here it goes

Posers & wanna-bes left-with-birds at sunset
Skate-pack stayed to get real-work-done

Jewels busy at the run-way back-n-forth
Zealous as an itch long-needed-scratch

Grinders chip-to-shit fine-ledges of stone workmanship
-life-errodes
Long-since weathered grafiti to explain to bank execs

South Side rich kids rolled in with a over-sized-Texas-truck 
They had recognized Jewels & swung around to park

Rollerbladers lept from the bed
Each hauling a rail over their shoulders

Each-in-turn busted on the rail 
krew-vs-krew tournament with the trophy respect 

Clay skin-glinted-in-sweat skated up to his crew not-in-line 
The best at Miller & the best on this scene as Jewels didn't count


'aww shit man you see what I busted-out 
'540 chuck-norris to 180

'AND I got that photo-pose

Clay shouted back to the crowd around the rail

'We be bust'n on that rail like Bukake 

Clay turned back to lean in close to Jewels

'Jewels tell me you seent it

Jewels nodded leant on her bike
Rollerblader offered her the swig of vodka-Mtn-Dew

He stopped her

'Waterfall-only-the-rule 

The others around had each perched to get next sip
Gave the rollerblader his just dues

Clay called ou

!Abe 

'Get a rotation yo

Abe hooted agreeably trying to impress the dealers & the scene phat with rich-kids
He pulled sag-up & flipped sack out folded in the sagged-Jinco-jeans

! bout-time
! imma-learn-yall-up-son

'This is how Miller rolls dat 
'Cherry Blunt

Clay spoke up

'You still got grape

Abe made a bounce at it

'If there are two in a pack
'& We just smoked one

'hmmm Clay 
'you need math

Abe chuckled foretelling his future

'Koreans gonna rob you at the cornerstone

Clay unimpressed

'Hey Abe

~ Yeah

Clay blew-him-a-burd

'Watch this kid 
'Imma trick this shit

'awwwww yeaaah

Jewels shot back a tip-of the head
Standing aside her bike

Her smile a big-flash-of-white

Clay distracted crashed & flipped ass-over-rail
_

Dealer in circle ready in turn for the puff-puff-pass

'We all go to Carol
'Gonna hit a few spots after this one

'No rent-a-cops

Truck large enough to pack three krew
Up-n-over Harbor Bridge to the North Beach Acquarium

Lexignton & abandonded attractions 
_

6am dropped off back at Staples street

Abe passed Jewels the wood-tip-cigar
Smoke let out in a thick cloud all around on curb under tree

All reeked pleasantly in mellow-tabbaco-stench

Early-morn & hungry no lunch
Clay called out more-wishful-than-hopeful 

! A Run-Run 

Attempting to inspire a grab & dash
At a elderly corner-store open down Staples 

All pretended to buy into the plan until the arrived at street-nexus 
Their real intention revealed split ways home

Clay disappointed but expecting the reaction

'Ahhh I see how it is

'Yall aint so hard man
'Yall go home to a fridge 

~ but man
'I got to crash at Dorsey

'His place broke-as-fuck
'We gonna eat bread again

Dorsey shook the patch of locks back & forth

'nah nah man 
'I aint going there

Moms new boyfriend a muthrfkr
Dorsey leant on Jordan

'shit Jordan hook us up with a crash
'we got no where to go near here

Jordan always the gatekeeper for their krew-spots

'Come on Jordan you know us man

Jordan knew this day would come
The day others would need to come to the Dunes

For this purpose Jordan had built a big-ass-obstruction
Conglomeration of rusted-car-tires-sand-sack-logs

Place looks like it been there decade
That the point of the turn-off-marker 

He moved the marker every couple months to throw off the trail
.
.
.
Summer breezes of salty air 

Sweat drained-un-ending off forehead & back
Out each day harder-than-before on stunt at hand

rail drop gap stair ledge slope
Farvorable lanes to secluded places like cemeteries

Different day conjoined to different krew
Corpus large but local-skaters kept certain spots 
_

Krew from Ray had two legit-kids 
Home-practice 1337 to bust-out-public

Novel technique unlocked at an early age got Jewels jealous

Flip'n their boards like coins
Yet each time 100% right
Total dominance of the 50% random-factor

Jewels day-long in ginger-sparky-red-flame
She her fails as great of her triumphs

Youngsters fueled in the cockiness of imporessing a Legend
Mission to bump off the legacy of older-generation 

new-kids-on-block
_

Miss always patched her together
Miss usually drunk wine in nest

Helps deal with the turmoil of bmx-legend
Miss all slurs & rants in unexpected-surgery
_

Last spot stuck far to east-side 
Trajectory askew by the sun & drugs 

Jewels rolled her iconic fat-cuban-roll
Blunt enfused to get them back-at-it

Potion unexpectedly reversed
Dumped them there square dead

Friend-of-guy came thru for solid
3am no-where-to-go-for-miles

Friend-of-guy wtf called outside well-past-midnight
Took-moment to dawn on him this mob now his problem

13 Bodies piled into a room, living-room, & garage
Dead-tired & able to pass out on anything

Morn a swift-sweep by a triggered-step-dad 
Jordan trolled on his way out to help add fuel

Tired-each parted to re-sleep else-where

Lazy Sunday dragged into afternoon-ride
Crash-out & woke up well-after-necessary

###########################
Dagons Eve holiday of Autumn's end 
Reserved to break into University Hospital 

Till then they lived as-life-presented

Core-krew out long-hitch with just-met-company
East Texas mountainous hills loomed great as mountains

Offer to join on-the-whim accepted
Destination a well-known-river too-far for their home-town 

Company would continue
But all of them assured a ride back to Corpus

After the park their friends paid a tube & a bus upriver

Todd spoke up to the clerk

'How much is to be dropped off at the furthest?

Ben commented

'Dont be rude

Clerk broke in happily

'Its the same price
'We got to keep that way on the runs anyway

'Be careful 
'High waters been known to white-water

Clerk looked at the all serious
But he knew on a warm-sunny-day to these lot it was helpless

'Listen if you get scared
'Just wait it out start you fires

Clerk looked up at Jewels assured

'By the next morn 
'It will all be over 

The Robbins parted quickly as had been met
Long haul to continue up quiet now
_

Dropped off alone out there 
Only a raging river in front

Dawned to realize their situation
Sun strong on them sweating

Jordan noised them all into assemple

! CARRRUMMMPPHHH

'Each has an extra tube 
'These will be for their packs

'Or in Jewels case
'Her Tome

'Which Todd here agreed to roll 2 packs

Rightly they observed accordance to Jordan
Heat of intense situations caused several severe fights
These sensitive matters

'We are going to chain them 
'They will be as a life-raft
'We ride along them

'Remember that with each bowline knot you tie to make this happen

'Todd im critisizing you
'Ben has respect
'Jewels is damn-to-strong
'I am the best

Jordan leant in on Todd to keep him wise

'You?
'wha-da-fk-r-u

'Your lines slip
'Can climb a rope to heaven with them skills

'altar-boy

Jordan tho mostly guiltless and undbout more redeemed in other areas
Never know his bounds to blow up
A pressure contained until forgotten ignited

Jewels was a good bouncer
All she do is step-in 

Primal fear of her 
Pain past any possible else-wise

Situation blown off completely

Miss preached

'As if in purge of a before the trials
'Heros 

'Prepare yourself

Jewels countered as she began her ultra-quick bowline-weaves of raft
Raft made up of a netted tube conglomeration

All went impatient into the river
An entire hour of work kill momentum

All braced for it
Todd yelled

'Around the turn
'Just us get thru this gorge

Todd was completely correct
Tho this forgotten so long of a turn it was

Ben broke his waterfall with boulder against his lower-back
Because the momentum was mostly forward serious damage avoided

Animals would not approach the banks
Needful but patient they awaited a calm time

Down river miles thru woods & ravines
Riven now pleasant & mellow

Each one of them bleeding

Jewels flipped-her-bit on Miss

Todd helpful translated for her
Loud enough for Miss to get the message unmistakable

! YOU ARE SMOKING CRACK IN  MY BODY 
! YOU-CRINKLY-WRINKLY-BITCH

Jordan pointed-out the approaching nightfall
Entirely relaxed leant against tube chewed cheese

'Go where we want all day

'Just set up camp
'At any these 
'beautiful bays at hand

'They got god-damn-sand

'oh-shit-Jewels
'!look

Across an ebb nested by dense-thicket

Nightshade-of-The-Witch dipped just above water-level
Jewels in a shudder of emotions unable to describe

Jewels drew out her dagger
Razor-sharp in respect of the plants & cat-skin she worked with day-to-day

She chose a bud from the bad & sliced
Set the bud in her preserving-sand

Jewels after time was known disappeared
Else-thought she been gathering longer
Expected it on how happy she was

TOME left there aside as she followed on a path
Thru the woods late at night without-word

Jordan flipped-a-bit 
A fit only learnt by Ben's example

! pack-this-shit-up

! RRRRAAAAAARRRRR

Jordan roared out to the world

'I will blaze my trail tracking her

'Ben double-check Todd's work

Todd gifted-him-the-burd
_

Breakdown & repack took the last of day-light

Ben excused by Jordan now flipped-his-own-bit
Expected she sure as shit be back by the time we are done

Cursing now that past hours time
Which was admittedly better after 
Hours of the the monotonoous call 

A shout full-volume

'i-see-the-fucking-moon-favor
'we-go-far-one

! she-leaves-us-behind
'she gives 0 shit

If Jewels returned she would immediately follow Jordan's signature blaze
Yet they fed off the crumbles which Jordan had to inspect much to find

Jordan by full-moon tracked the traces of her movement
Ben & Todd eager to learn from a master

Mud of puddles the best signs
Of what had passed near its region

Jewels Dr. Martin bootstompers hard in passage

Beavers damned springs & creeks which fed to the river
Lily bloomed bogs kept all muddy  to Jordan's favor

All huddled over one
Jewels-foot-print clear as day

'bitch is near 

Work a great trial to push him past his limits
Power of her gait crafty in elusive ways

Everyone exhausted

Ben threatened a promise he knew he could never keep
Todd exerted a monumental victory in the feat to keep-silence

They had two choices when they packed
Bring all but the tubes & ropes or set up camp

Todd had them haul the load 
Himself borne down by the TOME

Todd climbed up to the second-layer of a tree

'Just over the next knoll an opening

Jordan jumped at it
Confirmed by the collision with Jewels tread

Open grounds restful, compared to the pain of bushwacking
Each lifted of spirits knowing this the last of the thickets

A small valley brought a lone knoll into view opposite end
Boys bushwacked-thru expecting to confront Jewels at any moment

Wiccan conjury became apparent
With each passing doll or carved-symbol each forgave Jewels a bit more

Evidences of decades of lonliness wore all the decades since 
Grayness of age overgrown by the dense-green-fugus-of-life

Satchets attached to trunks of trees
Idols & tokens to ward off unwelcomes

A great totem pole confronted valley passage
Meticulously carved yet warped by time

At ease now 
Thicket behind them the last

Todd remembered from time with Jewels

'To lose sanity
'Only wanting home

'Basically thats what this does

A dark-garganteun-cloud cut all moon's light
True they all were insane already & Dunes remembrant

Spooked pack with Jordan led
Feel of his soles led the way

Todd thoughful left
Ben agressive right

Alleyup Jewels
also-known-as
Micheal Fly'n Jordan

They could all travel 
Aided likewise to bushwack
Aun empty of the superhuman power of Jewels

Now here a place
So long hard fought-faith

Testified front blissful

Overgrown by decades
Up pathed knoll 

Breach summit at turn of climb

Caught there several seconds
Able with the skin to feel
Tho blind summit


Cloud finally past
Thicket broke as if by magic & slight hump of slope
Panorama of peaceful mellow meadows of flowery greenary

Jewels deep in meditation
Front the doors
Tired just-got-there

~oh fk my friends
~fk i hate when they do that

~oh shit Miss
~what do I do

Purposefully loud & long cries
Drown out any response by Miss

She also sees this pleasant sight
Her troubles all vanquished 
Only the echoes of those few moment's infinity

Boys on the other hand
Drew up quite a stir

She had to train the pack again
Build a better bond

bruised-boys-learnt-lesson
_


Poisonous thickets & large-maned-spiders guarded over gateless hinges

Wild cats
First one then slowly others

/// over harem inside a small cave
/// Groves of marijuana & catnip

Jewels in an open meadow
Standing there with Miss

Front a great-hut of a mother-witch
mother-witch being grand-master

Cat & Coon kittens together playful
Moon-lit door-less open gateway

Omen welcomed the new-comers

Great well of water out front

Blue-gray stone all overgrown
Dark-greens moss & light-green vines 

Couple of kicks of Jewels
Threw back the world-off-course

Front-thick oak-door stubbonly flew across room
Fireplace pick scattered thrown across floor
Stone-exploded yet door held entact
_

Jordan quickly enamored with him self
Bugged Jewels in to the con of making all an shroom-elixir

Jewels needing to get busy con them into drinking it
Goys easily affected on shrooms would be out of her way

Marshmello & neon kelidoscopes thru a lost land
Transported by a unicorn guide

Jewels put her heart into it
_

Trippy-now in discovery

Smell of aromatic herbs proved beauty of the witch

Robe thin around waist & busty above
Had a master-craft towards beauty

Oak-chests after centuries dry & preserved
Jars of what happens after centuries sealed

By some magic printinely preserved

A snake of great lengths uncoiled from center of firepit

Jewels broomed the snake out to the meadow

Snake took to its tail
Stopped first get a long gaze of Jewels

Crows cawed & flocks arrived
Fire ablaze & boys over-worked in spring-cleaning

Far-past-too-high-too-realize-they-cleaning

Door a sturdy work-bench for Jewels 
Her strength crafted her a sturdy to the core work-bench

Tome-spread-eagle
Packed-of-new-entries

bowls jars kettles papers books clohes 
seeds bound-letters preserved-herbs

Fish-bone long no.7 out & cleaned
Ink rubbed into service

Learnt of her old master
Now presence of a different master

Keh Kay Gen Kai
Conjoined of two 

Witches each drastically-different
Yet common themes apparent

Hut preserved mostly-only the better for the wear
Work the sweep of what accumulates after decades

Gigantic cauldron over kitchen hearth glimmered-clean
Black Obsidian shined sleek

Gunk nothing against the buff of vigorous Jewels

squirels bats birds mice cats
All stole glances thru windows

Mice aun rode the felines
Yet cats regarded greater than mice

A fox cawed out fondly at front the door
Jordan rewarded it onf of his a dried-fish

Fox took the tip & skat off

Great-beam of moon bore down
Bright light kept all up

Jewels a slave-master always ordered chaos of trips-into-a-chore

~monotony helps the high
~mindless generate generic power
~used explicitly for a techique
_

grand-old-pecan to the left cottage overtook 3/4 of the bedroom
Braches of nuts inside the house in an organic fuse

Rear-double-doors suited to barrow out the ashes
Incineration a pleasant purge into dust

A great mound of ashe accumulated by next noon day 
Jewels had the boys mud-paste-ashe hours later next drink

An island-table boulder lay flat & stable
Molded by unknown means to have several drawers

Jordan cleared out a rotted-cupbord
He pulled a rusted pot & triggered a trap

Trap turnt past-worn-boredom into panic
Arrows flung & whipped-roots-lashed 

All poisonous 

Message carved over the slab that released the weapons 

~FEAR WITCH
~AS SNAKE
~AFTER DEATH

Poisonous after all these decades
Minor-severe wounds to all

Jordan pissed his pants
Tho blood made it hard to tell

Jewels just shrugged off the pulls 

~ no panic
~ all good

Jewels in lust as if this a long-waited-test
At her table 
Prepare ointment via herbs & flowers outside counteract the poison


Jordan asked confused

'da-fk wit her

Then the burn became audible out his mouth

! IIITTT BBBBUUUURRRRNNNNSSSSS

Meditation into nothing whilst Jewels concoct anti-dote

~ every witch grave
~ other witch treasure

Anti-dote instant relief
Pain & suffer turnt to relief

Ease as celluar massage
Purge cellers to better forms

Enlightenment lost-at-stiches
But regained quickly after patches 
_

Week went by comfortably

Jordan installed thorn-thicketeries
A blend he was able to morph in his odd al-chemic-wayz

After two summers own bushcraft naught penetrate barrier
Key out-tunnel down the 20-ft wide-well led out bypasse thorn-barrier

Journey much faster than the threat to retreat and manage position
Impossibly barred by a thorn-thickets too-green-to-burn
_

Field bloomed Kung-Fu energies in Todd to energize chi-root
Lessons of the soil & rock & root 

Three times a day

Jewels always the master of all
Boys needed to best her at one


Ben near insane & entirely difficult to deal with
His brain flips-a-bit when his last-battery-power-zeroes 

Jewels enthusiastic outmatched Ben's fits
Ben learnt to master himself in the corner sober
_

Dunes at ocean of transient-energy
Hut staurated with passionate bloom of seasonal-energies

Tabacco of this Witch's leave fused with methol 
Thick sweet cloud perfect for ring-wars

Zone energies thrived in Jewels invigorated presence
Champions bloomed all in the coranation of the new witch

Third night without sleep
All left of witch consumed in mind 

~no energy
~energy equal quantum-pure

Jewels summoned the Witch
Boiled flower & herbs inside couldron 

Audible-phantasm-aun-boys-heard
Wicked rasps of power 

Miss cowerd in her nest
Boys huddled together 

Boys ordered outside into the dark-night
Jewels weilded a two faggots
Handed one to Jordan & Todd 

~ witch bones in the well 
~ Ben help lower Jordan down

Ben looked at her

'Do not ask this of me

Jewels repented

~no sorry

~you doing it

Ben immediately launched into well

Jewels wanted to remind him to aim for the dark-spots
But he should know that by now-right

Jordan achored Ben with a rope to help with the fall

Ben via GriGri descented down

Yuck-of-narrowness of forever-dank-places
Centuries old civilizations & dominions
Upset by this unprecdented-passage of Ben

Ben almost water level caught of eye in moon-light
Yellowed bones stuck inside stone-wall
Buried as if climbed up on own volition

Ben forced to kneel down to collect all the teeth
A fine-sand-bed made the search certain

Jordan tossed-down a-make-shift broom
To scrub the well-moseleum-bottom 

Half-heartedly
Only that one-soaked-water over a week
 
A pyre erected over the mudpit in the middle of the field
Bones full of tumors now burnt to dusk 

Ashe planted in soil of the greenary

~ she not teach me
~ only  her burial
~ now gone forever

Miss explained

~ oh she taught you 
~ enough already
~ you bless-god & give-thanks

Tomes two sided 
Each the crest of her celestial-sisters

Equals each her to other

Both passed in the manner of flame
Under full moon

Lonely hermit endowed fondness for the fortune of burial of friend
Impossible in circumstance other-wise

Decades of wander alone 
Accompanied back to dust of entropy
_

Each in-the-shits due from a pecan-mostly-diet
Each gone farther than possible due to Jewels

Much passage of time
Before they would return

Wild herbs & pecan salads 
Jewels always kept pouches of oils & spices & herbs
She almost always made anything delicious 

Line-of-Felines  & Clusters of Mice instructed to duties
Principles passed down genereation to generation in royal line

Jordan worshiped by the mice who repaired his gear with lesssons of embroidery learned
Mice vests that proved the position of the mouse in society

Felines mixed over generations with a great many lost-cats 
Pets taken by owners too-close to river
For-ever stranded down-river

Lost & terrified pets assimilated into a hill infested by cat-harems

Packs of the females ferocious
Idle males muscular yet Scooby-Doo cuddly
_

Chores
Water-plants hunt-bug
pick-n-dry-n-store 

Chores cats tho distracted constantly managed eventually to complete
Even if act took a week
Enlongated to serve their pride & meaningless days

Chores mice took on immediately
Eager to resume business-as-usual of mousey-life
.
.
.
Starved of food burst in on a camp-site
Look like all escaped from jail

Friendly-gathering easily took in the pack
Fed & drunk gluttonous after dire-necessity

Locals to Corpus offered ride back out truck-bed

// Dropped under hot sun 
// No-where-cross-roads

// Stuck 5 hours midway at the next hitch
// Back in Corpus by night 

ck to the Dunes crashing waves beat welcome 
Waves beat in welcome crashes against the rock-out-cropping-of-rocks perimeter of Dunes
Splashes truly warm greeted them in reunion

Next days only light sun & chilly relaxation
Cold wind came by & blew over
_

Scotty led broke-skaters a mini-group of scavangers

The newest annoyed Jordan
Scotty punished them with a supply-run

Obligated by the simple fact

'Where else can you sleep & chill tonight

Five grateful poor-bastards from Miller High
Krew grateful for hands to prepare Friday-Pre-Dagon-Eve-Party

Bluen moonshine from the Bluff 
Drunk straight it glowed-green-tint 

DJ Ryder pulled up 808s & trucks
Alone his three truck entourage called all to party

Drawn deep as center city

Local krews from all regions present
Skaters bladers bikers punx dealers rednecks thugs
United where attendance defined legit each equal other

Party wild till dawn 

Jewels spiked the drink to morph the moonshine a color deep purple

Ben signed titties & had a super-star-night
Father of a worldwide network originated here hometown 

Prep for this party USB depleted world-markets 

Party named USB 

USB or you dont get in
Each left with a bootable-unix USB

Todd & Jordan & Jewels all envious of Ben
Especially Jewels who expected to have attention
Or atleast most of it but never none of it

Ben dawned as a White Rabbit 
Pick-of-the-litter adored him 
Floppy-bunny-ears & floppy-titties

Dagon Eve holiday celebrated region-wide
Open-celebration at bayfront end-to-end

Pagan ritualistic sacrifice endeared by tradition

Pigs or calves roasted

Carved as one of the members of the group 
Chosen member draped in semblance of animal

Honey / South-chili based coats unique to family-heirloom-recpie

City on great bay each front the open-ocean-street grill-pits flamed center road

A peaceful-time of brotherhoood
Harsh times blown off for flavor

Each pit the pride of a social-unit
Sections of the bay with long-standing-reputations past-generations

Locals only as the food too intense for strangers who let spice over-rule
Ritual symbolism odd to a point of creepy another repellent of non-locals
_

Roads shut down into the city
Too many tourist killed by children

special

An unspoken byword 

Children packed up this day each year

Parents dare not interfere

Mobs a swarm infested blocks of streets
Multitude growth exponential

March heard produced fear
Gun locked up away & cowering

Children march triumphant songs of dominance

If a certain child tags you special
In the inexplicable manner of children
A cloud of children convex like tiny Piranah

Waves & waves of minature-viciousness
Docile mask cast aside for this night
Faces of evil & demon-worship
Young-todler to the age of thirteen

Resistance to getting temporaryily shamed meant death
Reprisal against entire neighborhoods if a gunshot heard

Shooter's house burnt down
Ashes all them & close-kin
Multiplied out to neighbors

Bayside road alone the safe place to gather
_

Alley after dusk
Jordan set the tarps & locks over the bikes

Rustle of chains brought the attention of a patrol-policeman
PoPo car blup'd demands for attention

Lights hit them unepected 

'Hey what you doing back there

On instinct krew jumped a wall into a multi-level-park-lot 
A second set of cops executed a close-in & forced them to the terrible option of only ascending

Four ran their asses off doomed
Sound of the squeels of tires closer & closer

Top floor still void of answer

At top huddled five of the skaters from Miller

a small voice hissed

'ged-outta-here
'dont get us caught


another voice wailed 

'police made money via bail after arrests
'my mom is going to kill me for the bill

a final voice commanded

~shut tha fuck up Timmy
~you got them called breaking that window

The voice approached 
Light told him to be Shorty 

'oh shit 
'hey yall its Jewels

Startled by the look of distress left on Jewels face

'I mean
'You can just like obliterate the cops all HeMan
'right?

Knowledge of Jewels prescence immediately inspired any to prove-up

No where to go & the PoPo around the corner
A freshman had the answer
Thirteen no longer able to special & sad came up with the idea

'I was once 
'special

Immediately all submitted to the plan of the freshman
_

PoPo gout car on floor just-below
Side-by-side they walked up ramp to their trapped victims

Larger cop cursed

'fuck quotas Gary can suck my nutts
'like his wife did when she got caught drunk-driving

Partner agreed

'These brats are gonna pay
'I want a second shot this year
'Before she turns 40

10+ in one voice yelled

'SSPPPPEEEEEHHH
'SCCCCIAAALLL

Congradulations & aundulations set Freman titled to The Freshman
Memory made & enshired to be passed down generations in naming titles

Ben told Shorty

'ping worth 1000x 127.0.0.1

Shorty invited

'Hey my hoods have the best salooloah-dogs
'Ccome & tell everyone yourself

'Get hype up 
'People see Ben & Jewels there

Jewels audibly turnt

Ignorant Shorty oblivious

Jordan tried to shift focus

'We are on our way to break into Driscol

Skate crew became instantly silent
Shorty reinstated conversation

'Damn the Uni 
'Ballsy

Freshman displayed his pack of cans

'ohhh dude
'we could all tag it yea-ah

Dickhead from earlier smacked Freshman in back

'You will seriously go with them
'Go let me see get on 

Dickhead fronted him

'Yeah kid think before you speak

'Alright Jewels & rejecks
'Imma hit me up
'Them salooloah-dogs

Dickhead shouted from the otherside of the ramp entrance

'We will run by Uni on way back tonight
'Chill there on a case of iced-40oz

'Yall just gotta yell real loud
'Cuz is from Mexcio 
'Real cartel & shit we got you need whatev
_

Familiar ledge after the blessed-tree
All exposed for that brief moment to Downtown

Todd unlocked the window neatly all entered to the obscurity of the shadows of derelict Driscoll under Uni

First stop Jordan's locker at the extreme-other-end-of-school
They talked - not as quiet as thought- on the empty halls

A light sprang on far-faint-down-opposite-end
Krew froze Miss attuned her listening device

! HEARD
! SUM
! TIN

She near let out a cry of the annoable-loudness
Jewels predictive-hands clasped the cry silent

A giant shadow clambered about
Thick door raised from the stairwell

Opened light bore fantastic shadows


Loud yet more suble voice echoed

! DAGON

! EVE

! DIM

! WIT 

Shadows warped the head as if too tiny for great body
A enourmous torso wearing a diapers with a gnarly hook

Shadows departed quick as they came back lower floors

Jordan whispered angrily

'gdmit-fk-it
'told yall shut-the-fk-up

Ben brushed it off necessarily
'telling us to shut the fk up 
'is the start of all your conversation
'so it doesnt prove much

At the locker & Jordan fk-all
In a fit of elation ravished the Giant Panda Bear
Action quicker than any could turn away 

Over as quick as it begun
Jordan dusty now instead of the panda
Streams of sweat ran down painting a happy-face
Panda tied around his pack in a giant hug

Jordan said coyly in a very out-of-character-voice 
'girl i know you missed this
_

Towards the basement but first the closet
Jordan struggled this time more than at any lock-pick

Submitted to handsigns & only then able to work-it-out
Larger more rudimentary-picks used genericly

_

too-familiar-halls
Todd mello since morn

The girl who shit-so-bad where he dunked his foot
He may have definitely wished her dead in a curse

Torment of a day with shit-in-shoe
Then to realize later your caused her death

Mestration blood of girls
Blood he naively took as rust

Patients blood from blood layered on elevator cords

All these
tracked-down-and-killed
Due as consequence to his actions
_

First level across the Monitor Lounge
Unlocked closet door opened expelled air-thick-in-chemicals

Ben raised his skank over his nose
His algorithmn still proven sound 

Sure old code must have accomplished the un-crackable
Code he had written-down & proved since

Long-passage thru cleaning instruments drew sweat of nervous-energy to Ben's brow
A simple mis-step unknown could have left code dead-still-in-water only seconds after that fated day

Krew off to themslves at other ends of the hall
Ben this anxious flips-a-bit guranteed

Oddly in victory the fit is worse

Jordan off to himself on the pleasure-lane of reunion

Ben reached the end behind where stairs descended
Darkness felt his fingers  only a printer with an emtpy-tray

Nothing had printed 
Caz the paper blew or fell from the tray

Tonight he plans over crumbled to the core
Unable to reconfigure the a large-part-of-world-network

Ben had failed his mission to prepare

Ben flipped-his-shit
Printer flung here & there until it was no-where-yet-every-where

One of the last landing parts felt in a soft-thud
Fall softened by-layers-of-paper

Ben lifted them up
They the material that betrayed him

Aun dark the closet white paper revealed sane patterns
Sane patterns meant revelation of the key

Paper after pater proved the same pattern

Hundreds of them all identical
Proof after time-stemped proof

In Ben's embarassed apology he gave each a stack of the papers

Ben passed them stacks of paper

'Yeah you know
'Alot is on the line

'alright-fk-yall
'lets-go-im-ready

'Guard these with your lives

Ben also gave out a USB 
Rebuild the kernels of the network was only a plug-in & reboot

Hive-mind-survelient-system used against itself
Key allowed total interception & manipulation of traffic

Anonymous-only traffic based upon encrypted p2p web
Kernels critical nodes attached to the Undernet automatically

Order's great mission to replace nodes would swiftly give way to the power inherint in privacy
Months of rewiring & the ability to rework all computers individually to the old ineffienct network

Traffic One-Time-Only-Pre-Share-Keys-Anonymous tunnels
Bandwith of traffic improved 100-fold

Nodes contracted traffic to be proxy by other nodes
Aun still 10s times faster than old network
_

All now easily picked locks as experts
Office doors designed to be breach-able

Network wires a simple trace to the network-box
These gateways the magic place to insert & reboot

Flash of unix kernel took several minutes

Todd stopped front a framed-photo on a desk
LOCHNAR 

Displayed in the penthouse of the building

Two hours enough for several floors
Now the krew powered behind his plan

In elevator joined to rise to the Pent-house
Jewels hasitily hit the penthouse-button

Ben & Jordan too late in their admonishion
Elevator locked up in an alarm

Ben hacked at the controls

After sudden-drop, he swears non-leathal

Elevater began a sane ascension

// adventure is in each day of the way home
/////////////////////////////////////////////

An enourmou-expanse-of-black-hardwood-floor bordered a large pond off-center
Soft white sand beached a small island center pond 

Penthouse ceiling opened-up to the night sky
Salty winds of the ocean massaged skin

A long dark form lay o'r a dark-purple-boulder
A tail bobbed like iritated-cat

LOCHNAR resonated a green light to hum energy on the septer in hand of the laid creature
Orb in a song of light to first startled hum then into ejaculated pulsaion of energy

Enraged in the energies of a betrayed-betrothed a monster in jealous-charge

Screechs heraled the charge thru water to deck

'Miss so you have returned
'With Jewels the Treasure of Ebb-ave-lee

'We will guard skin after tonight

A form on the hardwood-deck thought to be driftwood sprung to life
Enlongated as it rose submereged mostly in the water

Giant 10m monster

Open penthouse gave room for gallant-charges 
Youth ready to end this ancient evil too long the villian

Giant hissed all too quick for a first-look

'Prophecy calls Jewels here for sacrifice

Certain to match its thick bones in a one-swipe-head-butt 
The first beached-creature bull-charged the krew

Frieght-train shut down 
crack-crack-crack...

Spinal columns snapped as Jewels met the collision full-force-heave Tome front

Creature now broken unable to move its mass 
Tauren-creature mer of the mar

Scaly long centipide of sections

Humans reworked into mechanism
Brains tucked into ribs 
Eyes replanted into shoulders
Chest to chest with the next
One long intestine connected to-top-ribcate-out-bottom-to-enter-next

Muscular arms with hands reshaped
Armored in ancient-ways of master-craft

Eyes open curiously desperate to get a good-view
Now mostly paniced to the paralysis of state

Upper body of tauren Naga oceanic
Torso-elongated as to put it on all fours for the charge dragged by lower-body

Rule one on Earth:

Fish stick to sea-fights
Mamals stay to ground-fights

Fish pampered
Cocky off its countless feeds

Kids hardened by seaons of toil & competition

Chain-n-lock swung remorseless by Jordan
Be-dazzeled-god-piece Todd's hammer
Crow-bar weilded Ben
Jewels unstruck Tome from pampered-face

///////////////////////////////////////////
All laid into the Seer until sashimi layed out
Flesh rich from life lived without want

None could deny a chew-or-two
Todd clutched the scepter of the LOCHNAR
To fulfill prophecy
LOCHNAR obiedient slave
//////////////////////////////////////////////

Giant lept now defeated last-dash to puncture a giant dark-sack
It hung as penthouse-centerpiece

Black-fog erupted like damned-water 
Darkness enveloped all in a sea

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Todd able to direct his chi to sever the non-native-portal
Native can not open portals on native realm
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tentacled arms long & barnacled probed Jordan
Instant to snatch him calculated

Lock-n-chain countered the attack
yet thick-barnacles sliced into his skin

A ink load hit half of Todd & Jordans right-leg
The ink burned yet not as bad as Hut Poison

Air now saturated in a darkness as a thick fog
Swift-movements dispersed it to momentary-clarity 

After recalculated damage from Jordan's strike
Tentacle whipt away

Jewels open-tome fanned all aside in great measures

A long crusted sword-fish-nose exploded into cloud of foggy mucus & blood
Fish fell down in a painful-rage of the quasi fog-water

Fog cleared to reveal a great host of the most awesome
All around trasnported to some malevolent-ocean-world

//////////////////////////////

Giant composed of a chain of torsos
Ribcage & Arms stiched in muscles as a snake

Bottom of ribcage wout feed out the neck connected to the next-ribcage
Skin of it a milky-softness of a new-born the rosy aspect of it unsettling

Some had noses others none
Noses clustered like mushrooms individually-sniffed-interested

Sitching required for this form done with fine-precision

Each arm honed to perfection
Each of the nails curated-in-paint with artistic nacissistic finesee

Arms moved & acted independently
But the whole driven as a catepillar
//////////////////////////////

All gripped by tentacles & flung tumbles-different-directions

Lobster-claw bit hard into Ben's thigh caught him mid-air

Jules & Todd countered the momentum of the throw
Tome cracked a Lobster-shell to give space to land 

Fear of the scene froze the region 
Jewels & Todd able to find ground

Darkness under starlight clear deep-night
Todd with the green-glow 
Right hand held the scepter

Todd did not recall when he took the sceptre
Chesire Cat flung tail to the limits of his periphreal

A voice surrounded Todd in the darkness

'You haunt my dreams?

'muha

'HaHAH

Breath now palpable against Todd's face
Nightmare face the source of the tentacles

'I am this worlds Dagon Image
'You the gate into your world

Dagon Image called out to all

~Nightmare to nightmares
~Sacrifice of Five


~Feed

Darkness of monolitich movements



A pack of hammer-head-sharks discovered at Todd's flank

Todd trusted his Passanger
A jump towards foremost hammer-head to dig bedazzeled-god-piece into flesh for a leverage up

Trajection of hammer-heads now put them on a turn-about 
Blinded by the rage of the humiliated leader

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
A darkness-blanketed-the-darkness in a forboarding pulsation-of-movement
White Noise a great cloud of tiny carnivorous fish 

Todd balled aganist a sea-plant
Gripped & pulled into the leaves

A shriek escaped him when his hairs charged
Plan shot out a electric pulse to fry the fish dead

Already dead is a much juicier choice for the hungry masses
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Hammerhead intercepted by Tome of Jewels swing
Leaderless troop retreated yet able to catapult Jewels near Ben 

Countless movements gave way to dodge the bouldered girl & her Tome
Ben caught upper-body by a big-headed-squid suction-cups ripped off-skin

Jewels made quick work of both lobster & squid
Now accustomed to the quasi-air-water

Great gasps as a shameful whimper escaped Ben 
Jewels slung Tome on back & cradled Ben

Instantly robbed of position now entrapt by awaited tentacles

Arched-form-of-a-woman illuminated in agony of electricution lit 360 as moon

Jewels stripped-naked & held in electrocution
Freckles burned in red-lights

Long clear flosfloresant tentacles gripped each part of her
Synced the shocks in pulsation

Jewels lit up in another great berth of agony
She awoke again to life

Cherry red crab-spider black crustation in the sharp points of King Crab
Fangs of thick saliva glowed to reveal terribleness

Spider shot out a thick-web-line as a whip
Web snatching a cluster of tentacles put the entire section out-of-sync

Next electrocution fumbled defenseless against a vindictive Jewels 

Jewels only too keen on the ways of pain
Explored all the nooks & crannys of of this Image till death

Spider, Ben & Todd aided noteworthy
Jewels carried tween Ben & Todd

Spider-crab here-till-ignored now needed to be dealt with
Here-fore-which careful non-verbal interactions not to ruin the good-vibes

Todd decided to ignore the Spider-crab in resolution

'We must find Jordan
'We only leave together

Jordan greeted popped out-under the Spider-crab shell

'sk-my-stinkies

Jordan replied to the amazement

'Dont ask me how 
'Passagers huh
_

Todd now as if possesed focused his chi to draw open a portal
All step back to their world

Late night penthouse 
Broken centerpiece hung over-head

Giant no where to be found
_

Two lower floors down they hid into a restroom

A familar scuttle passed-by 

Endurance of the trial of the moment past life-long-limits

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Bomb spewed out pepper-smoke into its face as mace
Eyes buldged into a visible painful reaction

Great torso double-mule-kicked
It flew into the glass shattering shards

Shards which sliced & stabbed it on the way down
Skanks up but room too small they dragged Jewels out

Now familiar with the structure they found a dummy-waiter as expected
Two at a time they hoisted down to the floor above the school
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Uni followed identical security protocol as Driscol
Krew managed to maneuver down the floors till they found a suitable shute

Landry-shute an out-of-play enjoyable-landing had it not been coated in
piss shit blood semen vomit

Jordan opened up conversation

'At least it soft

Ben looked back at him

'You have a torn finger-nail stuck below your left-eye 

Todd looked out the window

'We are on the East Side
'Just-bull-rush to the west-side

Get out the window adjacent to the tree
_

Jewels front-frieght-train

wheel-chairs-strew over
fk-the-world 
all pushed out of the way

Sirens in a blaze

One tough nurse known as Bus
Stays on the first floor for heavy-work

Jewels had one sure option
She stepped up the fire-extinguisher
Lept to other-side-of-wall
Sprung off into a full-kick-tween-shoulder-neck

Bus didn't have much of a neck
Kick slipped top to skull-crush-head

Jewels unstuck herself from mass-of-body toes-suspended all held by half a face
Accident only to be digested later 

Exit of Uni impossible from front
Doors more secure than a bank

Uni Hospital gets its money
Easy-way or hard-way

Jordan always to quick to catch
Dove in the doctor candy-stash

Late he got up to them

Todd in righteous flame burned at him
'There is no entrace to the shaft

Jordan accusative fast
'Then just make one

Jewels got the axe 
By then they were surrounded

Hopital thugs in redemption of Bus

Jordan's chain-n-lock spun to whurls
Behind Tood & Ben who backed-up Jewels 
2 axe-lengths behind

Jewels had and axe & proven to not have restraint
Short-stout-man called her bluff into a charge

Impossible to miss him but the axe have to split him 
Two as second-round filled the large hall

Jewels butt to skull & over flew
She came down axe lurched back

Two had only panic
Turing opposite direction
Each into their wall
In such a lurch to smash-into-then-back
Broken-nose to broken-nose

Jewels kicked into each chest in a stop & flip back
Bloody boulders cannonballed the mass behind

Short-man called cards on a bluff

Jewels only all in & in the sacred fire of all Ginger women everywhere
She landed from the flip careful to avoid the pools of blood

Mean-time boys in desperation to open the wall
Two others looked at the LOCHNAR sceptar

Only then did Todd realize even had the thing
Carried until now without his knowldege of picking it up
Like he entirely forgot about it

Todd now compelled to use its power
Todd began to eminate in green-glow

Jordan impatient
'WTF good a light gd-mit

Todd approached & parted the wall
Material now erased for them walk thru into the shaft to Driscol

Critters in swarms filled the sound of that shaft
One of many shafts that went as pipes
_

Inside the closet-door 
Patrols of mosters teemed

All jittery with empty-stomach
Fresh meat a savor once a decade

Patients let their savage-side take over
Mania may enter in the process of surgery-attached-assimilation

Royal-Forces to rich-kid
Human aquatic a patch-work

Appendage corrupted in a spasm of muscle over decades
Body now strunked to sustain the added-appendage

Noses like trunks with a tiny body
Legs & arms reattached to support orafices which always leaked acidic-mucus

Monster in a lumber towards them

Jordan in a moan
'fk-all-holy
'three floors of this shit

Lumber of redistributed organism sickened sanity

!!! POW

Top-left-chunck-of-nose obliterated in a red puff
A hairy clump smacked the floor in fron of them

A man down the hall dragged himself with his only arm
His legs chewed off all wounds seared.

He crawled in an escape in complete shock
'we come for you
'to take & lock-up

'monsters hit the main group
'when they too far

'i went in with the rest 
'to save my cousin

Guy baggled on helpless

He had one bullet left
They chould not help him so they just left

Bloody trails led to a room
Motion a clusterfk of smacks & breakage

Five crossed it very carefully
Monsters unintelligble-one-from-other busy

Bodies all in different stages of carnage
Crawler had snuck from here but there is no escape

Flesh chewed or carefully-slices to reattach to themself
A Nose front a pile of fingers
Hands busy attaching them in a train to support the front
_

Only blood streaks until the first floor
Dead monsters & cartel after hard-won-battle 

Clean up krew returning with orders to secure a hallway window
Both groups met at a corner-face-smash

Scoritaur upright head but horizantal torso
Spine to ass-hole connected into a mega-spine
Tip a wicked-bone worn into an axe

Backed off & then snaped back-bone
Backbone snared by a chain
Lock end caught something in a heave he scrunched it
Todd lauched Ben up who came down in a double-stop

Spinal columns exploded-out
Bones now protruding where monster-faces-were

Tail end un-aware until it too late
Jewels Tome held in a twirly full-body-swing
Splattered a bulbous creature against lockers
Mess after-wards could honestly have been anything

Distraction blew off the heads of the rest
Cartel armed with guns they spotted

Julio came up to them 
A expression of shock
Whatever in the past clearly of no import
'chinga-tu-madre-whey
'more these assholes
! desde-alla no podemos salir
Mortally wounded as the others & hysterical

Dead vatos both a blessing & a curse
Countless monsters now dead yet a swarm stirred
Latent pools of energy pooled by containment unleashed

Unleashed hordes now bounded out & up hospital floors
_

Todd remebered the dark visage had whispered
'more fate demands you to answer me
'fate will deman me to answer you

Caught quick as humans are weak
Scepter taken & able to see clear

Friends all surrounded despite Jordan's ingenuity
Allowed to take friends & leave thru a specific portal
Given back the sceptar

Fuzzed off as a high 
Low came just after long-glide

Vessel carried by his friends until this moment
Todd handsign to regain complete focus

Todd took the time to explain this
Without guiding principles dilemnas 

Group yet to give an answer
Rumbles of earth-quakes shuddered the bay

Death of the Seer
Staff long-since-dead
Monsters released from cell
Barrier broken in a damn

Aun Jewels stampeded-to-death if they not stay there 
Restroom with the longlasting remains of Julio & Emilio

Vent of First Communication exploded into Todd's hands as a relic
Creatures single-vision-escape by-passed them hid in the stalla

Todd knew certain they alone released the seed of Dagon to be spread to the world
Schrodinger Cat tho intelligent & insipid must put a father where there is offspring 

LOCHNAR a deep well of cosmic energy emitted by a soul or star
Todd a vessel chosen to breach barrier

Guiltless as he did not control his actions for some time
Todd to become Dagon egg to hatch in time as cosmic-portal
Entity to jump thru to birth vessel in this reality 
_

Jordan tied Julio & Emilio together around Jewels
They smacked each other in unwanted kisses
But the only buffers to full-frontals at the moment

Entire section of the building obliterated
Acidic silme as lava
Shoes half-melted to an unstoppable corrosion 

Made their way to industrial
If they helped everyone needed they'd gotten-no-where

No to survive at times
It is only certain few with ability
Honor to a debt to live-for-all

By time they able to save someone
Out in industry all still vacant 
_

In war men face themselves as monsters
Now man faced a monster without perception
Horror an infinite question of pain in reality

LochNess out to skyline burned-down any govt-weapon
Flame a demonic corrosion unlike fire known

Tentacles streched miles thru pipes over streets
Intelligent eyed appendages struck in percisions of muscles past milenium
_

Two types of monsters prodominant
WereFishes & Companies

WereFish
Aquatic-material converted onto human-creatures

Company
Human-material converted onto an aquatic creature
No longer human only a human appendage in a great-machine
Mechanical nodes to a conglomerate government

Loved ones ficious beasts
Monstrosities stop dead hearts

Humans splayed then stuck spine
Anesthesia put people high as fk

Disassemled carefully craftsman
Attached to monster at workbench 
Would work over an emotional victim

Laugh Cry Moan
whatever you wanted
Only at a hysteria
Anesethesia past pain

Visible fissures opened
Portals lead thru 

Entire bay infected
Friends devoured at best
Seen in operation at worst
_

Monsters + Conversions 
Exponetial growth fed more portals 
.
.
.
Ninjas on mission to find princess
Attracted by the smoke-bomb skills of Jewels 

Fight at what the world decided containment-only
Ignore a small wound in prayer it all go away

People still went there day-to-day for work
9-5 Time of day fish sleep & safe until 8

Companies now setteled on some land 
Mind at the new homestead to build their village

Areas easily avoided as neither wanted interaction
Shame of seeing a relative stressful for-entire-schedule

Dive to jump thru fissures
Portals empowered on lunar cycle
30 day limits set on treasure-hunt

Portals to worlds sacked by Dagon
Fish out spoils for the taking

HubBub Project

OVERVIEW
	HubBub offers a stable and secure network framework. 
	A low budget cost model is inherent by design. 
	HubBub is a network gateway leased at a monthly rate. 
	HubBub's low cost model is reciprocated to the company. 
	
	Hardware is only a Dell Optiplex 780 along with peripheral devices. 
	All under $200 per base unit. 
	HubBub was designed by a low level unix hacker. 
	
	All features of this network node have been manicured by its master craftsman. 
	All implementations are battle tested.
	All guarantees are personal.

HARDWARE & SOFTWARE LEASE
	After signing the lease, a HubBub will be shipped along with instructions. 
	Simply connect the computer via Ethernet to the Internet Service Provider Router with Dynamic Host Communication Protocol. 
	If the host network does not have DHCP an agent will be ready to walk each client setting up the network over chat.

STABILITY & SECURITY
	Stability & security is the specialty of the OpenBSD operating system kernel. 
	A pioneer in the field of network communication. 
	The kernel has the capability of authorizing packet movement by filtering ports and network-users. 
	Current production servers include Governments, Universities, and commercial giants like Adobe[0]. 
	OpenBSD is the favored choice among hackers for network firewall routers. 

REDUNDANT SERVICES
	Services include Network File System, File Transfer Protocol, Web, Voice over Internet Protocol, Mail, Internet Relay Chat & Secure Shell. 
	All source code is combed by our highest staff. 
	HubBubs contain a plethora of protocols to allow for alternative  vehicles to certain venues in advent of a disaster. 
	Ping, File Transfer, Message Passing are all as redundant as possible. 

GATEWAY
	Gateway - is as the Keystone of an Arch - to a network. 
	The Network Address Translation allows for a separate subnet for Home & Businesses. 
	Each HubBub carries a length of 25ft Wireless Access Point to allow for adjustable fields of coverage to WiFi. 
	Each HubBub carries a 100ft Ethernet Hub that allows for secure direct connections. 
	All traffic attached to this network will be connected to HubBub servers by Virtual Private Networks to allow for privacy. 

ANTI-SURVIELLENT TECHNOLOGY	
	Anti-Surveillent Technology is critical in global politics. 
	Mr. Comely, the fired FBI director, set an Agency objective that encryption should be made illegal [1]. 
	Our Internet Service Providers have been given monitoring power over our networks. 
	OpenBSD is Non-American cryptographic software maintained by a highly-dedicated team of skilled coders to sanitize all applications. 
	IBM admits “OpenBSD is quite possibly the most secure operating system on the planet” [2].
	All traffic passed through a HubBub will be obfuscated. 
	All packets will be encrypted communication that pour out of a variety of proxy connections that stem from the HubBub servers from which all packets pass.

TRANSIENT KERNEL
	OpenBSD has a GENERIC monolithic kernel. 
	It's wide set of drivers allow for a Transient Kernel. 
	Backup, Pull & Plug Solid State Drive to a new host machine, and Duplication are all simplified. 
	Each kernel is transient and stable to allow for low server downtime. A fall back server is a recommended option.

NETWORK SATELLITE
	Network Satellites are laptops per-configured for encrypted access from public connections.  
	Files, logs, mail, messages, and voice; will all be available through this laptop in confidence. 
	Extensive Field Testing has been passed too allow paranoid-free access to basic elements of a computer system.

COMPANY STANDARD
	HubBub has the endgame of changing the shape of networks globally. 
	The objective is to build importance of Authorized Virtual Networks which are private networks consisted of secured nodes.

# SUMMARY
Preserving more than 10+ Million
Unique files of significance

Each file stored as its $sha
Metadata is stored as 'g'$sha

ZFS over BSD
SICC Implementation:

Files are split into blocks
Named after the sha256sum

All files in one directory
All metadata in another directory

This isolation of metadata from data
Allows for public gibberish
To be private information
